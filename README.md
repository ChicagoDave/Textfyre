# textfyre

This repository is the sharable artifacts from Textfyre, Inc, a now closed commercial IF company that existed from 2007 through 2014.

You are free to use everything within here although I would note that the ownership of The Shadow in the Cathedral story reverted back
to Ian Finley and Jon Ingold. If you intend to use or extend that story, you should politely inquire with them before doing so.

Secret Letter remains under my care, but if you'd like to change or extend that storyline, just ask. I'm open to the idea.

The story Empath's Gift is owned by Paul O'Brian and Chris Huang. Contact them accordingly if needed.

All code, including FyreVM is free to modify and use in your IF endeavors.

David Cornelson, ex-Founder, Textfyre, Inc.

Note that the artwork for all of our stories is not here for obvious reasons. When the art was created, it was for publishing in-game
and not for general purpose use. I don't have rights to upload it to the web as-is.
