It's your second year at the LEAP summer camp, and so far it's been as great as you remember last year to have been.  Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls "your girlfriends", much to your embarrassment) are here again.  You spent yesterday catching up on the news in between options and classes, and now you're settling in with the smug sensation of not being a raw newbie any more.

The LEAP summer camp isn't quite the same as most summer camps.  LEAP is an acronym for "Learning Enrichment Activity Programme"; the brainchild of world-renowned educator Professor Damon Rose, it is housed on the campus of the University of Colorado at Valmont, and was created for Gifted and Talented Kids (gosh, that sounds impressive) to expand their horizons and encourage them to stretch their mental capabilities.

Whatever. That's all in the promotional flyers. You just know that you're in for two weeks of the sort of interesting classes you don't get in school, and a bunch of fun options with which to fill up the free time after classes.  This evening, for instance, you've signed up for a scavenger hunt....


Please press SPACE to continue.
LEAP, Day 2.  Evening.

"Okay, kids!" Michelle, the counselor in charge of the scavenger hunt option waves her hands to settle the crowd around you, before finally remembering her whistle.  A brief fweep sweeps through the room.  "Okay, does everyone have their list?  Everyone good?  Okay!  You have until 8:25 pm to find everything on your lists, return here, and show me your lists so I can check them.  So synchronise your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!"

Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.

First Floor Lobby, West
This used to be the living room, back when Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, the eccentric old coot who donated this place to the university was still alive and the university was just starting up.  It's got a huge fireplace, and a big bay window looking out onto the front lawn.  It's also been painted completely white from floor to ceiling, so thickly that you're not sure if some of the molding is not actually just bubbles under the paint.  The info desk is back through the arch to the north, and the lobby continues, through another arch, to the west.

A large brass plaque has been fixed into the space over the fireplace.

[placeholder text: "Room description text about Michelle."]

>[need to watch out for british spellings, e.g. programme]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x michelle
Michelle Close is one of the counselors.  She's slightly untidy-looking, with a big explosion of curly black hair and a pencil tucked behind one ear.

>[because this chapter (along with many others) is on a timer, it's going to be crucial that we're judicious about what sorts of moves consume game time.]

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x plaque
It's shaped like a shield, and commemorates the memory of Damon Rose, one of the founders of LEAP.  You remember him quite well from last year.  It was quite a shock to hear about the accident, and there was some question as to whether LEAP could go on without him.  His sister, Claudia Rose, is in charge of LEAP now, and making sure that the good work goes on.  She seems like a nice lady, but she's just not quite as present as old Damon Rose used to be.

>x paint
It was the fashion, back in the 1950s, to try to make a place look more modern by painting it white.  It's not the 1950s anymore, but apparently nobody ever told the custodians that.

>x bubbles
They're annoyingly random.  You don't know why the original painters couldn't have taken the trouble to -- oh wait, that's actually an elaborate wood molding.

It's pretty elaborate, and almost makes you dizzy as you follow the pattern across the -- oh wait, those are just air bubbles under the paint.

Normally you can see all of the front lawn spread out from here, but right now there've been temporary walls set up all over the lawn.

Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

Old AQJ, who left his mansion to the university, stares down benevolently from his portrait.  You never cease to be amazed at his enormous sidewhiskers.

They're called Dundrearies, though you can't see anything remotely dreary about them.  Maybe one day you'll grow something like that, if Mom doesn't attack you with sheepshearing equipment first.

It's very sleek and modern-looking, which means it's oddly shaped and doesn't fit anywhere.  A never-ending supply of LEAP flyers are stacked in a corner.  Tucked away into a corner is a small saucer for loose change.  (The receptionist usually keeps this in a corner of the desk where only she can see it, but apparently it's been moved.  She's only here during the school year, anyway.)

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

>x cutouts
(the images of winter sports)
You see far too many of those here.

>x pouch
It's full of cutouts of snowboards, skis, hockey sticks, skates, sleds and other things that make you want to put on your scarf and your warm, woolly mittens.

First Floor Rooms East
This is the east end of the first floor dorm area.  Through the window at the end of the hall, you can see Calvin Field North and a bunch of campers running about in the summer sunshine.  In here, you are surrounded by images of people having snowball fights.  The fire stairs at this end of the hall go up and down.

Second Floor Rooms East
The girls at this end of the corridor seem to prefer movie posters to cutouts of actors.  The only cutout here is a lifesize Humphrey Bogart, on the door to the fire stairs.  Opposite Bogey, to the north, is Ava and Stacy's room, while behind Bogey are stairs going up and down.  And at the end of the corridor is, of course, the window overlooking Calvin Field, and stardom continues back to the west.

Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade in "The Maltese Falcon": trenchcoat, fedora, world-weary expression, and a general air of noir-ness.  Apparently he's guarding the stairs.

You haven't heard of half of these films.  You wouldn't watch most of the others.  The remaining few are pretty good, though: you know that those were put up by your friends Ava and Stacy, who at least have some sense in them.

Second Floor Lobby
Hooray for Hollywood!  The words are emblazoned right across the wall, over a cutout of Audrey Hepburn holding a pouch full of smaller cutouts of other Hollywood stars.  The glamour continues east and west, to where the younger girl campers are roomed, while the stairs go up and down.

A few tables have been set up here for the RPG option, and the campers involved seem thoroughly absorbed in the unfolding story.

8:25!  Time's up!  You hurry back to the starting point with your list and everything you've found so far....

First Floor Lobby, West
This used to be the living room, back when old AQJ was still alive and the university was just starting up.  It's got a huge fireplace, and a big bay window looking out onto the front lawn.  It's also been painted completely white from floor to ceiling, so thickly that you're not sure if some of the molding is not actually just bubbles under the paint.  The info desk is back through the arch to the north, and the lobby continues, through another arch, to the west.

A large brass plaque has been fixed into the space over the fireplace.

[placeholder text: "Room description text about Michelle."]

Michelle scans your list, looks over your findings, and shakes her head.  "Well, it was a good try, Daniel, but I'm afraid you haven't found everything.  Better luck next time!"

It takes you a few moments to realize that "the bitter taste of defeat" is, in this case, not a figure of speech: the air literally does taste bitter.


Please press SPACE to continue.

Well, that was odd.

Those sudden flashes of sensory hallucination (what else would you call them?) seem to die down over the course of the next day.  The headaches and dizzy spells are so mild now as to be practically gone, but on the other hand, the frequency seems to be increasing.  It's all somewhere in the back of your head: if you focus, you can almost always find... something.  A smell, or a sound that isn't there.  A peculiar flavour hanging in the air.

Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.  You could talk to Aidan, but he'd probably just march you straight up to the hospital.  He'd even carry you there if he had to.  So where does that leave you?

LEAP, Day 3 (Tuesday) - Dorm Time

Your roommate, Jeremy, went off with some friends after dinner, which leaves you alone for now.  It's dorm time, which means you have maybe a couple of hours or so before lights-out, all to yourself.  Some people spend the time reading, or listening to music, or visiting friends.  Which reminds you, maybe talking to Stacy and Ava about this would be the best thing to do.  Maybe they'll tell you it's all part of being eleven years old, or something.

Yeah.  You can hope.

[A new goal was added: visit Ava & Stacy]

Your Room
You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooller.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.

>[hmm. text referring to "flashes" is sketchy when I've only had one. There should probably be more locations where we can be sure that Daniel will get an odd sensory message. I'm happy to collaborate on figuring those out if necessary. ]

Are you sure you want to restart? yes




It's your second year at the LEAP summer camp, and so far it's been as great as you remember last year to have been.  Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls "your girlfriends", much to your embarrassment) are here again.  You spent yesterday catching up on the news in between options and classes, and now you're settling in with the smug sensation of not being a raw newbie any more.

The LEAP summer camp isn't quite the same as most summer camps.  LEAP is an acronym for "Learning Enrichment Activity Programme"; the brainchild of world-renowned educator Professor Damon Rose, it is housed on the campus of the University of Colorado at Valmont, and was created for Gifted and Talented Kids (gosh, that sounds impressive) to expand their horizons and encourage them to stretch their mental capabilities.

Whatever. That's all in the promotional flyers. You just know that you're in for two weeks of the sort of interesting classes you don't get in school, and a bunch of fun options with which to fill up the free time after classes.  This evening, for instance, you've signed up for a scavenger hunt....


Please press SPACE to continue.
LEAP, Day 2.  Evening.

"Okay, kids!" Michelle, the counselor in charge of the scavenger hunt option waves her hands to settle the crowd around you, before finally remembering her whistle.  A brief fweep sweeps through the room.  "Okay, does everyone have their list?  Everyone good?  Okay!  You have until 8:25 pm to find everything on your lists, return here, and show me your lists so I can check them.  So synchronise your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!"

Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.

First Floor Lobby, West
This used to be the living room, back when Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, the eccentric old coot who donated this place to the university was still alive and the university was just starting up.  It's got a huge fireplace, and a big bay window looking out onto the front lawn.  It's also been painted completely white from floor to ceiling, so thickly that you're not sure if some of the molding is not actually just bubbles under the paint.  The info desk is back through the arch to the north, and the lobby continues, through another arch, to the west.

A large brass plaque has been fixed into the space over the fireplace.

Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

>n

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

>u

Second Floor Lobby
Hooray for Hollywood!  The words are emblazoned right across the wall, over a cutout of Audrey Hepburn holding a pouch full of smaller cutouts of other Hollywood stars.  The glamour continues east and west, to where the younger girl campers are roomed, while the stairs go up and down.

A few tables have been set up here for the RPG option, and the campers involved seem thoroughly absorbed in the unfolding story.

>w

Second Floor Rooms West
The large window at this end of the corridor would normally look out over Second Avenue, but someone's gone and plastered it over with cutouts of every actor who's ever played James Bond.  There's definitely a spy thriller motif going on here: the only surfaces not covered with more of the same are the doors to the rooms and the door to the fire stairs, which continue up and down from here.  The way back to the east looks significantly less cloak-and-dagger.

Third Floor Rooms West
In defiance of the prescribed decoration scheme, someone has stuck a large poster of one of Van Gogh's "Starry Night" paintings on the wall here.  The scattering of constellations around seem small and weak by comparison.  There is also the window overlooking Second Avenue, surrounded by a thicket of stars; meanwhile, the fire stairs only go down from here, and the corridor continues back to the east.

Third Floor Lobby
This is where the older girls have their rooms.  The walls are painted a very dark blue, and there are planets, stars and all things space-age stuck all over the place.  A cutout of an astronaut holds out a pouch full of astronomical bits; the corridor itself extends east and west, and the stairs continue down to the rest of the dorms and up to the roof.

Under a particularly starry patch of ceiling, a group of campers, including your brother Aidan, are engaged in some freeform improvised poetry.  This is the Rap Session option, you think.

As you enter the area, you experience a momentary headache and the urge to sneeze.  The feeling disappears quickly, but evidently not quickly enough because Aidan clearly seems to have noticed something wrong.  He breaks away from the rest of his option and comes up to you. 

"Hey, Daniel, you okay?"

1. "Yeah, I'm fine."
2. "No, I'm getting these dizzy spells and headaches."

>2
"No, I'm getting these dizzy spells and headaches."

Aidan frowns.  "Could be something you ate.  Brad Kramer's your counselor, isn't he?  Want me to go get him?"

1. "Thanks, but I think I'll be able to find him myself."
2. "No, I'll be fine.  It's nothing, really."
3. "Uh, no, thanks.  (Aidan, you're embarrassing me!)"

>2
"No, I'll be fine.  It's nothing, really."

"Whatever you say, tough guy."  Aidan ruffles your hair, and for a moment, but only a moment, something buzzes in your ears.  Aidan resumes his seat with the other rappers.

Aidan is your big brother.  He looks quite a lot like you, only taller and broader.  He's pretty cool; he just turned 15 a couple of months ago, but hasn't gotten too cool to be seen with you yet.  On the other hand, if your secret plot to grow up just like him works out, he'll never get too cool for you.

Third Floor Rooms East
This end of the corridor looks like the inside of a space shuttle.  Someone's gone to great care to create window-like frames for the stars and planets and whatnot; even the window overlooking Calvin Field has been made to look like a space shuttle viewport.  Outer Space is back to the west; presumably the planet Earth is down the stairs.

>x earth

>x viewport
You have to wonder what the Powers That Be think of people actually applying paint to the walls.  I mean, there's a reason they provided cutouts to paste onto the walls, and that you can take off again.  Then again, well, there's no way anyone could have done all this in the short time you've been here, so quite probably it was done by the college kids during the semester and the Powers That Be decided to just go with the theme rather than call in the graffiti removal squad.

The girls at this end of the corridor seem to prefer movie posters to cutouts of actors.  The only cutout here is a lifesize Humphrey Bogart, on the door to the fire stairs.  Opposite Bogey, to the north, is Ava and Stacy's room, while behind Bogey are stairs going up and down.  And at the end of the corridor is, of course, the window overlooking Calvin Field, and stardom continues back to the west.

Rooftop
The rooftop is only accessible when there's an activity or option that uses it.  Otherwise, it's off-limits, not that you can really imagine why anyone would want to come up here.  It's all black gravel and tar.  The courtyard downstairs is way more pleasant.

The Eggdrop option is busy tossing boxes of eggs over the parapet: a table has been set up as well, and is covered with artsy-craftsy materials with which a number of campers are building egg-preservation containers.

On the eggdrop option table are some shish-kebab skewers.

As you emerge into the sunlight, you feel a momentary dizziness that makes you almost want to hurl.  The feeling is gone very quickly, but your heart is left pumping as though you'd just run a couple of miles.

This used to be the living room, back when old AQJ was still alive and the university was just starting up.  It's got a huge fireplace, and a big bay window looking out onto the front lawn.  It's also been painted completely white from floor to ceiling, so thickly that you're not sure if some of the molding is not actually just bubbles under the paint.  The info desk is back through the arch to the north, and the lobby continues, through another arch, to the west.

A large brass plaque has been fixed into the space over the fireplace.

[placeholder text: "Room description text about Michelle."]

Michelle scans your list, looks over your findings, and shakes her head.  "Well, it was a good try, Daniel, but I'm afraid you haven't found everything.  Better luck next time!"

It takes you a few moments to realize that "the bitter taste of defeat" is, in this case, not a figure of speech: the air literally does taste bitter.


Please press SPACE to continue.

Well, that was odd.

Those sudden flashes of sensory hallucination (what else would you call them?) seem to die down over the course of the next day.  The headaches and dizzy spells are so mild now as to be practically gone, but on the other hand, the frequency seems to be increasing.  It's all somewhere in the back of your head: if you focus, you can almost always find... something.  A smell, or a sound that isn't there.  A peculiar flavour hanging in the air.

Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.  You could talk to Aidan, but he'd probably just march you straight up to the hospital.  He'd even carry you there if he had to.  So where does that leave you?



Please press SPACE to continue.


LEAP, Day 3 (Tuesday) - Dorm Time

Your roommate, Jeremy, went off with some friends after dinner, which leaves you alone for now.  It's dorm time, which means you have maybe a couple of hours or so before lights-out, all to yourself.  Some people spend the time reading, or listening to music, or visiting friends.  Which reminds you, maybe talking to Stacy and Ava about this would be the best thing to do.  Maybe they'll tell you it's all part of being eleven years old, or something.

Yeah.  You can hope.

[A new goal was added: visit Ava & Stacy]

Your Room
You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooller.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.

>restart
Are you sure you want to restart? yes




It's your second year at the LEAP summer camp, and so far it's been as great as you remember last year to have been.  Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls "your girlfriends", much to your embarrassment) are here again.  You spent yesterday catching up on the news in between options and classes, and now you're settling in with the smug sensation of not being a raw newbie any more.

The LEAP summer camp isn't quite the same as most summer camps.  LEAP is an acronym for "Learning Enrichment Activity Programme"; the brainchild of world-renowned educator Professor Damon Rose, it is housed on the campus of the University of Colorado at Valmont, and was created for Gifted and Talented Kids (gosh, that sounds impressive) to expand their horizons and encourage them to stretch their mental capabilities.

Whatever. That's all in the promotional flyers. You just know that you're in for two weeks of the sort of interesting classes you don't get in school, and a bunch of fun options with which to fill up the free time after classes.  This evening, for instance, you've signed up for a scavenger hunt....


Please press SPACE to continue.
LEAP, Day 2.  Evening.

"Okay, kids!" Michelle, the counselor in charge of the scavenger hunt option waves her hands to settle the crowd around you, before finally remembering her whistle.  A brief fweep sweeps through the room.  "Okay, does everyone have their list?  Everyone good?  Okay!  You have until 8:25 pm to find everything on your lists, return here, and show me your lists so I can check them.  So synchronise your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!"

Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.

First Floor Rooms West
You're at the west end of the first floor dorm area.  The winter sports theme continues on in spite of the summer sunshine streaming in through the window.  Aidan's room is to the north, flanked by a pair of matching hockey sticks, and you could take the fire stairs up or down.

Pits West
This end of the Pits hallway is somewhat less spooky than the rest: the paper skeletons dancing across the walls all seem quite cheerful and not at all threatening.  Dim light filters in through a high window, through which you can see the bushes and assorted shrubbery growing up against the building.  From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.

Pits Stairwell
This is the Pits, and evidently someone thought it would be a good idea to decorate the area dedicated to housing newbies with images taken from classic horror movies.  Frankenstein's monster looms over the doorway to the south, as if standing guard outside the Pits Lobby, while werewolves and vampires romp away to the east and west.  The stairs themselves lead back upstairs to the wintery delights of the first floor.

Your room is at this end of the Pits hallway, just to the south of here.  You've elected to cover your door with the biggest cutout of a werewolf that you can find, because werewolves are cool.  The hallway continues west, and a high window on the east wall looks out across Calvin Field North.  Right beside your room door is the fire stair leading back upstairs.

Rowrr.  Sure, werewolves are supposed to be scary, but you can't help but think they're too cool to be lumped together with all the zombies and vampires and assorted creeps that make up the standard classic horror fare.

Pits Lobby Central
This section of the Pits is part of the older part of Jacobs Hall, and therefore cut up into more interesting shapes.  There are a bunch of storerooms, all of them locked, and then two very large halls to the east and west.  A passage to the north leads back to the main stairwell.  Apparently there used to be another staircase here going up, but it was ripped out to give this place a little more elbow room.

This part of the Pits used to be the kitchen, once upon a time.  Imagine, having the kitchen in the basement, downstairs from the dining room!  All the kitchen equipment's been removed now, though, and the place is used as a sort of recreation room.  There are several Ping Pong tables here, and a Ping Pong tournament going in full swing.  The central lobby is back to the west.

Ava and Stacy have both taken this option and are waiting for their turn at the ping pong tables.

>x tables
Regulation ping pong tables.  You could call them table tennis tables, but that sounds a little redundant.

>x stacy
You met Stacy last year, here at LEAP.  She's a skinny blonde girl with freckles and rather prominent front teeth.  She likes playing with gadgets, and is so full of nervous energy she could probably swallow an elephant and not gain an ounce of weight.  She's also wearing a neat little straw hat with a pink ribbon trailing behind.

"Hey, Stacy," you say, "I don't suppose I could borrow your hat for a bit, could I?"

"What?  What am I supposed to wear, then?"

1. "Please?"
2. "I know you've got a bunch of other hats you could wear."
3. "Come on, it's for the scavenger hunt.  Please?"

>3
"Come on, it's for the scavenger hunt.  Please?"

Stacy hesitates a little, then sweeps the hat off her head.  "Okay, fine.  But if you ruin it, I'll kill you with a screwdriver."

[You achieved a goal! (finding a hat)]

8:25!  Time's up!  You hurry back to the starting point with your list and everything you've found so far....

First Floor Lobby, West
This used to be the living room, back when old AQJ was still alive and the university was just starting up.  It's got a huge fireplace, and a big bay window looking out onto the front lawn.  It's also been painted completely white from floor to ceiling, so thickly that you're not sure if some of the molding is not actually just bubbles under the paint.  The info desk is back through the arch to the north, and the lobby continues, through another arch, to the west.

A large brass plaque has been fixed into the space over the fireplace.

[placeholder text: "Room description text about Michelle."]

Michelle scans your list, looks over your findings, and shakes her head.  "Well, it was a good try, Daniel, but I'm afraid you haven't found everything.  Better luck next time!"

It takes you a few moments to realize that "the bitter taste of defeat" is, in this case, not a figure of speech: the air literally does taste bitter.


Please press SPACE to continue.

Well, that was odd.

Those sudden flashes of sensory hallucination (what else would you call them?) seem to die down over the course of the next day.  The headaches and dizzy spells are so mild now as to be practically gone, but on the other hand, the frequency seems to be increasing.  It's all somewhere in the back of your head: if you focus, you can almost always find... something.  A smell, or a sound that isn't there.  A peculiar flavour hanging in the air.

Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.  You could talk to Aidan, but he'd probably just march you straight up to the hospital.  He'd even carry you there if he had to.  So where does that leave you?



Please press SPACE to continue.


LEAP, Day 3 (Tuesday) - Dorm Time

Your roommate, Jeremy, went off with some friends after dinner, which leaves you alone for now.  It's dorm time, which means you have maybe a couple of hours or so before lights-out, all to yourself.  Some people spend the time reading, or listening to music, or visiting friends.  Which reminds you, maybe talking to Stacy and Ava about this would be the best thing to do.  Maybe they'll tell you it's all part of being eleven years old, or something.

Yeah.  You can hope.

[A new goal was added: visit Ava & Stacy]

Your Room
You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooller.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.

>restart
Are you sure you want to restart? yes




It's your second year at the LEAP summer camp, and so far it's been as great as you remember last year to have been.  Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls "your girlfriends", much to your embarrassment) are here again.  You spent yesterday catching up on the news in between options and classes, and now you're settling in with the smug sensation of not being a raw newbie any more.

The LEAP summer camp isn't quite the same as most summer camps.  LEAP is an acronym for "Learning Enrichment Activity Programme"; the brainchild of world-renowned educator Professor Damon Rose, it is housed on the campus of the University of Colorado at Valmont, and was created for Gifted and Talented Kids (gosh, that sounds impressive) to expand their horizons and encourage them to stretch their mental capabilities.

Whatever. That's all in the promotional flyers. You just know that you're in for two weeks of the sort of interesting classes you don't get in school, and a bunch of fun options with which to fill up the free time after classes.  This evening, for instance, you've signed up for a scavenger hunt....


Please press SPACE to continue.
LEAP, Day 2.  Evening.

"Okay, kids!" Michelle, the counselor in charge of the scavenger hunt option waves her hands to settle the crowd around you, before finally remembering her whistle.  A brief fweep sweeps through the room.  "Okay, does everyone have their list?  Everyone good?  Okay!  You have until 8:25 pm to find everything on your lists, return here, and show me your lists so I can check them.  So synchronise your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!"

Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.

The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

Pits Lobby West
This windowless area used to be a wine cellar, but today it's like something out of science-fiction.  It's being used for the Virtuality option, and there are cables and computers and virtual reality equipment all over the place.  It's a little alarming, in fact, knowing that many of these campers -- the ones wearing the goggles, anyway -- can't actually see you.  The central lobby is back to the east.

>x campers
It's really quite amazing.  You'll have to sign up the next time this becomes available.

>x equipment
Clearly money was not an issue when supplying the program with computers.  These are all powerful, top-of-the-line models, as they have to be to run the virtual reality software.  They're also new this year: last year's computers, though pretty good, weren't exactly NASA quality.

Pits Lobby Central
This section of the Pits is part of the older part of Jacobs Hall, and therefore cut up into more interesting shapes.  There are a bunch of storerooms, all of them locked, and then two very large halls to the east and west.  A passage to the north leads back to the main stairwell.  Apparently there used to be another staircase here going up, but it was ripped out to give this place a little more elbow room.

Pits Stairwell
This is the Pits, and evidently someone thought it would be a good idea to decorate the area dedicated to housing newbies with images taken from classic horror movies.  Frankenstein's monster looms over the doorway to the south, as if standing guard outside the Pits Lobby, while werewolves and vampires romp away to the east and west.  The stairs themselves lead back upstairs to the wintery delights of the first floor.

>sw

Pits West
This end of the Pits hallway is somewhat less spooky than the rest: the paper skeletons dancing across the walls all seem quite cheerful and not at all threatening.  Dim light filters in through a high window, through which you can see the bushes and assorted shrubbery growing up against the building.  From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

Hooray for Hollywood!  The words are emblazoned right across the wall, over a cutout of Audrey Hepburn holding a pouch full of smaller cutouts of other Hollywood stars.  The glamour continues east and west, to where the younger girl campers are roomed, while the stairs go up and down.

A few tables have been set up here for the RPG option, and the campers involved seem thoroughly absorbed in the unfolding story.

Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

Calvin Field North
Claremont Hall, to the north, looms over the entire length of Calvin Field, which continues to the south.  Jacobs Hall is back to the west, and the dining hall is to the east.  A fountain takes up space right where all the paths meet, so there usually aren't that many people running around and tearing up the grass.  Right now, though, there are several people running around, playing Myth Tag, and there's nothing the fountain can do about it.

>[there should be a bit of description to make the transition from indoors to outdoors less jarring. Like "You exit through the double doors and into the bright sunshine."]
I didn't understand that sentence.

>[I love the humor in these descriptions. "there's nothing the fountain can do about it" is great.]
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x fountain
The fountain consists of a wide, shallow basin and a modern sculpture that, to you, looks a lot like Big Foot taking a shower.  It's not running right now.

8:25!  Time's up!  You hurry back to the starting point with your list and everything you've found so far....

First Floor Lobby, West
This used to be the living room, back when old AQJ was still alive and the university was just starting up.  It's got a huge fireplace, and a big bay window looking out onto the front lawn.  It's also been painted completely white from floor to ceiling, so thickly that you're not sure if some of the molding is not actually just bubbles under the paint.  The info desk is back through the arch to the north, and the lobby continues, through another arch, to the west.

A large brass plaque has been fixed into the space over the fireplace.

[placeholder text: "Room description text about Michelle."]

Michelle scans your list, looks over your findings, and shakes her head.  "Well, it was a good try, Daniel, but I'm afraid you haven't found everything.  Better luck next time!"

It takes you a few moments to realize that "the bitter taste of defeat" is, in this case, not a figure of speech: the air literally does taste bitter.


Please press SPACE to continue.

Well, that was odd.

Those sudden flashes of sensory hallucination (what else would you call them?) seem to die down over the course of the next day.  The headaches and dizzy spells are so mild now as to be practically gone, but on the other hand, the frequency seems to be increasing.  It's all somewhere in the back of your head: if you focus, you can almost always find... something.  A smell, or a sound that isn't there.  A peculiar flavour hanging in the air.

Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.  You could talk to Aidan, but he'd probably just march you straight up to the hospital.  He'd even carry you there if he had to.  So where does that leave you?

LEAP, Day 3 (Tuesday) - Dorm Time

Your roommate, Jeremy, went off with some friends after dinner, which leaves you alone for now.  It's dorm time, which means you have maybe a couple of hours or so before lights-out, all to yourself.  Some people spend the time reading, or listening to music, or visiting friends.  Which reminds you, maybe talking to Stacy and Ava about this would be the best thing to do.  Maybe they'll tell you it's all part of being eleven years old, or something.

Yeah.  You can hope.

[A new goal was added: visit Ava & Stacy]

Your Room
You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooller.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.

>restart
Are you sure you want to restart? yes




It's your second year at the LEAP summer camp, and so far it's been as great as you remember last year to have been.  Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls "your girlfriends", much to your embarrassment) are here again.  You spent yesterday catching up on the news in between options and classes, and now you're settling in with the smug sensation of not being a raw newbie any more.

The LEAP summer camp isn't quite the same as most summer camps.  LEAP is an acronym for "Learning Enrichment Activity Programme"; the brainchild of world-renowned educator Professor Damon Rose, it is housed on the campus of the University of Colorado at Valmont, and was created for Gifted and Talented Kids (gosh, that sounds impressive) to expand their horizons and encourage them to stretch their mental capabilities.

Whatever. That's all in the promotional flyers. You just know that you're in for two weeks of the sort of interesting classes you don't get in school, and a bunch of fun options with which to fill up the free time after classes.  This evening, for instance, you've signed up for a scavenger hunt....


Please press SPACE to continue.
LEAP, Day 2.  Evening.

"Okay, kids!" Michelle, the counselor in charge of the scavenger hunt option waves her hands to settle the crowd around you, before finally remembering her whistle.  A brief fweep sweeps through the room.  "Okay, does everyone have their list?  Everyone good?  Okay!  You have until 8:25 pm to find everything on your lists, return here, and show me your lists so I can check them.  So synchronise your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!"

Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.

Calvin Field South
During the school year, this part of Calvin Field gets pretty scuffed up by students playing football or whatever inter-department sports tickle their fancy at the time.

Michelle scans your list, looks over your findings, and shakes her head.  "Well, it was a good try, Daniel, but I'm afraid you haven't found everything.  Better luck next time!"

It takes you a few moments to realize that "the bitter taste of defeat" is, in this case, not a figure of speech: the air literally does taste bitter.

Well, that was odd.

Those sudden flashes of sensory hallucination (what else would you call them?) seem to die down over the course of the next day.  The headaches and dizzy spells are so mild now as to be practically gone, but on the other hand, the frequency seems to be increasing.  It's all somewhere in the back of your head: if you focus, you can almost always find... something.  A smell, or a sound that isn't there.  A peculiar flavour hanging in the air.

Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.  You could talk to Aidan, but he'd probably just march you straight up to the hospital.  He'd even carry you there if he had to.  So where does that leave you?

LEAP, Day 3 (Tuesday) - Dorm Time

Your roommate, Jeremy, went off with some friends after dinner, which leaves you alone for now.  It's dorm time, which means you have maybe a couple of hours or so before lights-out, all to yourself.  Some people spend the time reading, or listening to music, or visiting friends.  Which reminds you, maybe talking to Stacy and Ava about this would be the best thing to do.  Maybe they'll tell you it's all part of being eleven years old, or something.

Yeah.  You can hope.

[A new goal was added: visit Ava & Stacy]

Your Room
You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooller.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.

>[okay, that's enough for now. more tomorrow if I can.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>quit
Are you sure you want to quit? yes
