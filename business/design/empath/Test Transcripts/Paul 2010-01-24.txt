It's your second year at the LEAP summer camp, and so far it's been as great as you remember last year to have been.  Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls "your girlfriends", much to your embarrassment) are here again.  You spent yesterday catching up on the news in between options and classes, and now you're settling in with the smug sensation of not being a raw newbie any more.

The LEAP summer camp isn't quite the same as most summer camps.  LEAP is an acronym for "Learning Enrichment Activity Programme"; the brainchild of world-renowned educator Professor Damon Rose, it is housed on the campus of the University of Colorado at Valmont, and was created for Gifted and Talented Kids (gosh, that sounds impressive) to expand their horizons and encourage them to stretch their mental capabilities.

Whatever. That's all in the promotional flyers. You just know that you're in for two weeks of the sort of interesting classes you don't get in school, and a bunch of fun options with which to fill up the free time after classes.  This evening, for instance, you've signed up for a scavenger hunt....


Please press SPACE to continue.
LEAP, Day 2.  Evening.

"Okay, kids!" Michelle, the counselor in charge of the scavenger hunt option waves her hands to settle the crowd around you, before finally remembering her whistle.  A brief fweep sweeps through the room.  "Okay, does everyone have their list?  Everyone good?  Okay!  You have until 8:25 pm to find everything on your lists, return here, and show me your lists so I can check them.  So synchronise your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!"

Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.

First Floor Lobby, West
This used to be the living room, back when Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, the eccentric old coot who donated this place to the university was still alive and the university was just starting up.  It's got a huge fireplace, and a big bay window looking out onto the front lawn.  It's also been painted completely white from floor to ceiling, so thickly that you're not sure if some of the molding is not actually just bubbles under the paint.  The info desk is back through the arch to the north, and the lobby continues, through another arch, to the west.

A large brass plaque has been fixed into the space over the fireplace.

[placeholder text: "Room description text about Michelle."]

Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

>get coins
You quickly swipe the loose change and hope that nobody saw you.

>w

Second Avenue
Second Avenue runs north and south along the edge of a cliff: to the west is a sharp drop down (don't even try) onto the rooftops of the buildings along First Avenue, and beyond those are the jagged ridges of the Rockies.  Jacobs Hall -- the old part, anyway -- is open to the east, and its front lawn spreads out to the southeast.  You can also go northeast, squeezing around the newer part of Jacobs Hall to the courtyard beyond.

Conveniently, a bus shelter with a newspaper vending machine is almost directly outside the Hall.

>put coins in machine
You insert the appropriate change, and the glass front of the vending machine clicks open to spit the day's newspaper out at your feet.

>[just a slight description note -- the newspaper vending machines around here don't spit the paper out at your feet. Instead, it's like a cage that you can open once you've paid your money. You reach inside and grab a newspaper.]
I didn't understand that sentence.

>get newspaper
Taken.

[You achieved a goal! (finding a newspaper)]

>x it
You quickly scan the headlines.  War, pollution, corruption, crime, gas shortages... why anyone would want to start their day with such a sour note, you do not know.

>x shelter
You figure that the next bus should be showing up about one minute after you leave.

>[ha!]

It's more of an escarpment, really, or so Aidan told you once.  You not quite sure about the difference.  Anyway, Valmont is built on a mountainside, so you see this sort of thing all the time.

Courtyard
The courtyard is a hard, concrete square ringed by bushes and trees.  It's not terribly interesting, but Aidan sometimes comes here to play basketball with his friends, as if the camp counselors didn't make you all run around enough already.  The other university buildings are visible beyond the treetops, and the blank north face of Jacobs Hall rises up to the south; paths southeast and southwest lead around Jacobs Hall, though there is no entrance to the building from here.

Calvin Field North
Claremont Hall, to the north, looms over the entire length of Calvin Field, which continues to the south.  Jacobs Hall is back to the west, and the dining hall is to the east.  A fountain takes up space right where all the paths meet, so there usually aren't that many people running around and tearing up the grass.  Right now, though, there are several people running around, playing Myth Tag, and there's nothing the fountain can do about it.

A whole bunch of walls have been temporarily erected all over the front lawn for the Graffiti Art option.  The smell of paint is everywhere, not to mention the hiss of spray cans.  Passersby on Second Avenue -- to the northwest -- will no doubt find this all very interesting.  A flagpole rises up from the maze of makeshift walls here, while Calvin Field and the more athletic options are off to the east.

Calvin Field South
During the school year, this part of Calvin Field gets pretty scuffed up by students playing football or whatever inter-department sports tickle their fancy at the time.  Right now, it's getting scuffed up by people playing flag football.  The university caretakers must be wondering why they even bother to replant the grass every Spring.  The less scuffed-up part of Calvin Field is to the north, and the front lawn of Jacobs Hall is to the west.

First Floor Lobby, East
This used to be a rather large dining room, once upon a time, and it still has a low-hanging chandelier right in the middle of the ceiling.  A piano's been pushed under the chandelier so that nobody accidentally gets a head full of crystal walking blindly around, and the place is generally used as a kind of music room now.

>x chandelier
Pretty, but mostly useless.  You suspect that it's more glass than crystal these days, too: you distinctly remember someone (who certainly wasn't you, no sir!) knocking out part of it with an enthusiastic trombone slide last year, but this year there appears to be no sign of the damage.

The info desk is back through the arch to the north, and the lobby continues, through another arch, to the west.

A large brass plaque has been fixed into the space over the fireplace.

[placeholder text: "Room description text about Michelle."]

Michelle scans your list, looks over your findings, and shakes her head.  "Well, it was an excellent effort, Daniel, but I'm afraid you haven't found everything.  Better luck next time!"

It takes you a few moments to realize that "the bitter taste of defeat" is, in this case, not a figure of speech: the air literally does taste bitter.


Please press SPACE to continue.

Well, that was odd.

Those sudden flashes of sensory hallucination (what else would you call them?) seem to die down over the course of the next day.  The headaches and dizzy spells are so mild now as to be practically gone, but on the other hand, the frequency seems to be increasing.  It's all somewhere in the back of your head: if you focus, you can almost always find... something.  A smell, or a sound that isn't there.  A peculiar flavour hanging in the air.

Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.  You could talk to Aidan, but he'd probably just march you straight up to the hospital.  He'd even carry you there if he had to.  So where does that leave you?

LEAP, Day 3 (Tuesday) - Dorm Time

Your roommate, Jeremy, went off with some friends after dinner, which leaves you alone for now.  It's dorm time, which means you have maybe a couple of hours or so before lights-out, all to yourself.  Some people spend the time reading, or listening to music, or visiting friends.  Which reminds you, maybe talking to Stacy and Ava about this would be the best thing to do.  Maybe they'll tell you it's all part of being eleven years old, or something.

Yeah.  You can hope.

[A new goal was added: visit Ava & Stacy]

Your Room
You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooller.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.

>restart
Are you sure you want to restart? yes




It's your second year at the LEAP summer camp, and so far it's been as great as you remember last year to have been.  Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls "your girlfriends", much to your embarrassment) are here again.  You spent yesterday catching up on the news in between options and classes, and now you're settling in with the smug sensation of not being a raw newbie any more.

The LEAP summer camp isn't quite the same as most summer camps.  LEAP is an acronym for "Learning Enrichment Activity Programme"; the brainchild of world-renowned educator Professor Damon Rose, it is housed on the campus of the University of Colorado at Valmont, and was created for Gifted and Talented Kids (gosh, that sounds impressive) to expand their horizons and encourage them to stretch their mental capabilities.

Whatever. That's all in the promotional flyers. You just know that you're in for two weeks of the sort of interesting classes you don't get in school, and a bunch of fun options with which to fill up the free time after classes.  This evening, for instance, you've signed up for a scavenger hunt....


Please press SPACE to continue.
LEAP, Day 2.  Evening.

"Okay, kids!" Michelle, the counselor in charge of the scavenger hunt option waves her hands to settle the crowd around you, before finally remembering her whistle.  A brief fweep sweeps through the room.  "Okay, does everyone have their list?  Everyone good?  Okay!  You have until 8:25 pm to find everything on your lists, return here, and show me your lists so I can check them.  So synchronise your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!"

Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.

The info desk is back through the arch to the north, and the lobby continues, through another arch, to the west.

A large brass plaque has been fixed into the space over the fireplace.

First Floor Lobby, East
This used to be a rather large dining room, once upon a time, and it still has a low-hanging chandelier right in the middle of the ceiling.  A piano's been pushed under the chandelier so that nobody accidentally gets a head full of crystal walking blindly around, and the place is generally used as a kind of music room now.  The info desk is back to the northwest, and to the west is the rest of the first floor lobby.  Wide picture windows looks out on the front lawn and on the southern part of Calvin Field.

>get dinosaur
You pick out a purple diplodocus from the pile of plastic dinosaurs.

[You achieved a goal! (finding a dinosaur)]

Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

>get coins
You quickly swipe the loose change and hope that nobody saw you.

Second Avenue
Second Avenue runs north and south along the edge of a cliff: to the west is a sharp drop down (don't even try) onto the rooftops of the buildings along First Avenue, and beyond those are the jagged ridges of the Rockies.  Jacobs Hall -- the old part, anyway -- is open to the east, and its front lawn spreads out to the southeast.  You can also go northeast, squeezing around the newer part of Jacobs Hall to the courtyard beyond.

Conveniently, a bus shelter with a newspaper vending machine is almost directly outside the Hall.

>put coins in machine
You insert the appropriate change, and the glass front of the vending machine clicks open to spit the day's newspaper out at your feet.

Front Lawn
A whole bunch of walls have been temporarily erected all over the front lawn for the Graffiti Art option.  The smell of paint is everywhere, not to mention the hiss of spray cans.  Passersby on Second Avenue -- to the northwest -- will no doubt find this all very interesting.  A flagpole rises up from the maze of makeshift walls here, while Calvin Field and the more athletic options are off to the east.

>e

Calvin Field South
During the school year, this part of Calvin Field gets pretty scuffed up by students playing football or whatever inter-department sports tickle their fancy at the time.  Right now, it's getting scuffed up by people playing flag football.  The university caretakers must be wondering why they even bother to replant the grass every Spring.  The less scuffed-up part of Calvin Field is to the north, and the front lawn of Jacobs Hall is to the west.

Calvin Field North
Claremont Hall, to the north, looms over the entire length of Calvin Field, which continues to the south.  Jacobs Hall is back to the west, and the dining hall is to the east.  A fountain takes up space right where all the paths meet, so there usually aren't that many people running around and tearing up the grass.  Right now, though, there are several people running around, playing Myth Tag, and there's nothing the fountain can do about it.

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

>u

Second Floor Lobby
Hooray for Hollywood!  The words are emblazoned right across the wall, over a cutout of Audrey Hepburn holding a pouch full of smaller cutouts of other Hollywood stars.  The glamour continues east and west, to where the younger girl campers are roomed, while the stairs go up and down.

A few tables have been set up here for the RPG option, and the campers involved seem thoroughly absorbed in the unfolding story.

Third Floor Lobby
This is where the older girls have their rooms.  The walls are painted a very dark blue, and there are planets, stars and all things space-age stuck all over the place.  A cutout of an astronaut holds out a pouch full of astronomical bits; the corridor itself extends east and west, and the stairs continue down to the rest of the dorms and up to the roof.

Under a particularly starry patch of ceiling, a group of campers, including your brother Aidan, are engaged in some freeform improvised poetry.  This is the Rap Session option, you think.

As you enter the area, you experience a momentary headache and the urge to sneeze.  The feeling disappears quickly, but evidently not quickly enough because Aidan clearly seems to have noticed something wrong.  He breaks away from the rest of his option and comes up to you. 

"Hey, Daniel, you okay?"

1. "Yeah, I'm fine."
2. "No, I'm getting these dizzy spells and headaches."

>u
Rooftop
The rooftop is only accessible when there's an activity or option that uses it.  Otherwise, it's off-limits, not that you can really imagine why anyone would want to come up here.  It's all black gravel and tar.  The courtyard downstairs is way more pleasant.

The Eggdrop option is busy tossing boxes of eggs over the parapet: a table has been set up as well, and is covered with artsy-craftsy materials with which a number of campers are building egg-preservation containers.

On the eggdrop option table are some shish-kebab skewers.

As you emerge into the sunlight, you feel a momentary dizziness that makes you almost want to hurl.  The feeling is gone very quickly, but your heart is left pumping as though you'd just run a couple of miles.

It's covered with artsy-craftsy materials: cardboard boxes, egg cartons, feathers, bits of cloth, sticks, rubber bands, and so on.  There are also several cartons of eggs.

[placeholder text: "Room description text about Michelle."]

Michelle takes your list, then searches about herself for a pencil (completely missing the one behind her ear and the two pens in her pocket) before finally pulling out a magic marker.  She nods as she ticks off the items from the list.  "Nice going, Daniel," she says, smiling, "that's everything on the list.  You win!"  She slaps a blue ribbon on your chest and turns to address the next camper.

The numb sensation in the side of your head takes a few moments to clear completely.

Well, that was odd.

Those sudden flashes of sensory hallucination (what else would you call them?) seem to die down over the course of the next day.  The headaches and dizzy spells are so mild now as to be practically gone, but on the other hand, the frequency seems to be increasing.  It's all somewhere in the back of your head: if you focus, you can almost always find... something.  A smell, or a sound that isn't there.  A peculiar flavour hanging in the air.

Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.  You could talk to Aidan, but he'd probably just march you straight up to the hospital.  He'd even carry you there if he had to.  So where does that leave you?

LEAP, Day 3 (Tuesday) - Dorm Time

Your roommate, Jeremy, went off with some friends after dinner, which leaves you alone for now.  It's dorm time, which means you have maybe a couple of hours or so before lights-out, all to yourself.  Some people spend the time reading, or listening to music, or visiting friends.  Which reminds you, maybe talking to Stacy and Ava about this would be the best thing to do.  Maybe they'll tell you it's all part of being eleven years old, or something.

Yeah.  You can hope.

[A new goal was added: visit Ava & Stacy]

Your Room
You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooller.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.

>["cooller" -> "cooler"]
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x desk
A standard, regulation LEAP desk, with a built-in electrical outlet for your laptop if you have one.  The actual outlet is probably in some inconvenient place behind the desk, but why they couldn't just supply you with a power bar, you don't know.  Well, you suppose desks with built-in outlets are pretty cool.  Just... not as cool as werewolves.

>[hee hee]
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x outlet
You see nothing special about the built-in electrical outlet.

>x bed
A standard, regulation LEAP bed, with nothing under it but dust.  You've looked several times, especially in the mornings when you can't find your keys.

You find nothing of interest.

Which do you mean, the cutout werewolf or the cutout vampire?

>vampire
It is a mystery to you why anyone would think these snotty, bloodless monsters are cool, except in the sense of being cold, dead bodies.  Also, this particular vampire cutout seems to have a disconcerting way of following you with his eyes, which is really creepy.

>x werewolf
He's on the other side of the door.  Thinking about it now, maybe you should have let Jeremy put his vampire cutout on that side instead, and wolfie on this side.

Second Floor Rooms East
The girls at this end of the corridor seem to prefer movie posters to cutouts of actors.  The only cutout here is a lifesize Humphrey Bogart, on the door to the fire stairs.  Opposite Bogey, to the north, is Ava and Stacy's room, while behind Bogey are stairs going up and down.  And at the end of the corridor is, of course, the window overlooking Calvin Field, and stardom continues back to the west.

>n
(first opening Ava and Stacy's door)
You don't think either of the girls would appreciate you just barging in on them like that.

>knock on door
Ava peeks out and breaks into a smile when she sees you.  "Hey, Daniel!"  She pulls you inside.  "What's up?"

Ava and Stacy's room
Ava and Stacy both keep their respective sides of the room perfectly tidy; it's rather intimidating, actually.  You can tell whose side is whose by the stuff they keep on their desks: Ava has a CD player, an assortment of CDs, and a few books; Stacy has a few broken gadgets that she's fixing, probably because she broke them to begin with.  One of them has taped a poster for "Casablanca" on the door to the south.

Stacy looks up from her desk, where a few hundred tiny electronic parts are scattered.  "We were just talking about how lately you seem distracted all the time.  Is something wrong?"

Ava looks a little embarrassed.  "We're just concerned.  You know."

1. "I don't know what's happening...."
2. "Well, I'm getting these headaches...."
3. "There's nothing wrong.  Can't a guy visit his friends every now and then?"

[You achieved a goal! (visit Ava & Stacy)]

>1
"I don't know what's happening...."

You tell Ava and Stacy about the headaches, the dizzy spells, and the hallucinations.  Only of course you don't call them hallucinations, because they'd think you're going nuts for sure.  Ava says, "that sounds serious.  Maybe you should see a doctor."

1. "Over my dead body."
2. "I'm not that sick."

>2
"I'm not that sick."

"That's what they all say," says Stacy, "right before they keel over dead."

"I don't know," says Ava, "it sounds pretty serious to me.  And we've noticed you sometimes stopping in the hallway with your eyes sort of glazed over."

1. "Is it that obvious?"
2. "Have you two been spying on me?"

>[ha ha stacy dialogue]
I didn't understand that sentence.

>1
"Is it that obvious?"

"Mostly to Ava, says Stacy, "because Ava notices these things.  I would have totally missed it if she hadn't pointed it out as we were coming back from dinner earlier."  You remember feeling a little nauseous as you walked by the Info Desk.  You thought it might have been something you ate.  "Personally," Stacy continues, "I'm kind of wondering if maybe it could be real.  The sounds and stuff you told us about, I mean."

Ava frowns.  "Stacy, how can it possibly be real?  Nobody else noticed anything."

"Nobody else noticed Daniel getting all glassy-eyed and green either.  Look, Daniel, there's a very easy way to find out.  If there's something at the Info Desk that's making you sick, then going there again will bring back the same feeling, right?  So we could just go there and see how consistent these feelings are."

1. "They're pretty consistent, now I think about it.  Always at the same place... sort of.  I mean, unless something's changed about the place since."
2. "Consistent? They're just random.  I never know when I'm going to suddenly get this feeling, whatever it is."

>1
"They're pretty consistent, now I think about it.  Always at the same place... sort of.  I mean, unless something's changed about the place since."

Ava looks thoughtful.  "It could be some sort of allergy, I suppose.  Maybe we could find out exactly what's causing this, and fix it."

"Okay, then!"  Stacy grins cheerfully as she pulls a deerstalker cap out of her dresser.  "I'd say we have a mystery to solve."

Ava gets out a notebook and pen.  "Just try to focus, Daniel.  We'll get to the bottom of this."

[A new goal was added: investigate odd sensations]

You met Ava last year, here at LEAP.  She's a rosy-cheeked girl with long, brown pigtails; since last year, she's also acquired a pair of glasses that, she claims, make her look like a young Nana Mouskouri.

You met Stacy last year, here at LEAP.  She's a skinny blonde girl with freckles and rather prominent front teeth.  She likes playing with gadgets, and is so full of nervous energy she could probably swallow an elephant and not gain an ounce of weight.

Under a particularly starry patch of ceiling, a group of campers, including your brother Aidan, are engaged in some freeform improvised poetry.  This is the Rap Session option, you think.

Rooftop
The rooftop is only accessible when there's an activity or option that uses it.  Otherwise, it's off-limits, not that you can really imagine why anyone would want to come up here.  It's all black gravel and tar.  The courtyard downstairs is way more pleasant.

The Eggdrop option is busy tossing boxes of eggs over the parapet: a table has been set up as well, and is covered with artsy-craftsy materials with which a number of campers are building egg-preservation containers.

On the eggdrop option table are some shish-kebab skewers.

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air. 

"Daniel," says Ava, "Daniel, you're getting that funny look again.  Is whatever-it-is somewhere around here?"

"Try to focus," says Stacy.

Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

Second Avenue
Second Avenue runs north and south along the edge of a cliff: to the west is a sharp drop down (don't even try) onto the rooftops of the buildings along First Avenue, and beyond those are the jagged ridges of the Rockies.  Jacobs Hall -- the old part, anyway -- is open to the east, and its front lawn spreads out to the southeast.  You can also go northeast, squeezing around the newer part of Jacobs Hall to the courtyard beyond.

Conveniently, a bus shelter with a newspaper vending machine is almost directly outside the Hall.

Calvin Field North
Claremont Hall, to the north, looms over the entire length of Calvin Field, which continues to the south.  Jacobs Hall is back to the west, and the dining hall is to the east.  A fountain takes up space right where all the paths meet, so there usually aren't that many people running around and tearing up the grass.  Right now, though, there are several people running around, playing Myth Tag, and there's nothing the fountain can do about it.

Pits Stairwell
This is the Pits, and evidently someone thought it would be a good idea to decorate the area dedicated to housing newbies with images taken from classic horror movies.  Frankenstein's monster looms over the doorway to the south, as if standing guard outside the Pits Lobby, while werewolves and vampires romp away to the east and west.

Pits West
This end of the Pits hallway is somewhat less spooky than the rest: the paper skeletons dancing across the walls all seem quite cheerful and not at all threatening.

From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.

Stacy quickly shuts up when the door opens a crack, and a rather timid little guy peeks out at you.  He fairly reeks of that mysterious sour-salty air.  And now you think you can hear some sort of twittering in the background, too.  It occurs to you that you remember seeing him up at the egg-drop option yesterday, though he certainly wasn't giving off this... whatever it is... back then.

"Hi," says Ava, who seems to recognise the guy.  "Lucian, isn't it?  We met yesterday at the sign-ups.  Anyway, these are my friends Daniel and Stacy.  May we come in for a moment?"

Lucian lets the door swing half-open and sighs resignedly.  "Sure, if you want," he says, retreating back into the room.  The three of you follow him inside.

Lucian's Room
It's another dorm room, not much different from your own.  Lucian's desk and bed are on one side; a CD player, playing [SONG] over and over, sits on his desk beside a couple of framed photographs.

[placeholder text: "Room description text about Lucian."]

[A new goal was added: find out what happened to Lucian]

>[also, bless you for parsing "try to focus"]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x lucian
Lucian's a little shrimp of a newbie.  He looks rather pale and colorless, with thin white-blonde hair plastered close to his scalp.  In short, he's rather typical bully-bait.

>x photographs
There are two of them.  One appears to be a class photograph taken a year or two ago: there's an older man, maybe in his fifties, surrounded by a bunch of kids, in front of a blackboard.  The other is much older, judging by the clothes and hair, and shows a cheerful little old lady sitting on a bench in a colorful flower garden.

You look at the two photographs.  There's one of a little old lady in a garden.  The other is a class photograph.

1. "Is that your class picture?  What was your teacher like?"
2. "Who's the lady in that picture?  Is she your grandmother?"

>1
"Is that your class picture?  What was your teacher like?"

Lucian picks up the class photo.  "That's Peter," he says, pointing to the teacher smiling up from one side of the group.  For a moment, the sour taste in the air disappears.  "He lets us call him by his first name, and he's the most awesome teacher ever."  Then Lucian looks sad again.  "He's the one who said I was smart enough to come here, and he went and pulled all sorts of strings.  I should be grateful, I suppose."

1. "But you're not?  Why?"

>1
"But you're not?  Why?"

"I don't know anybody here and I'm all alone.  Why shouldn't I be unhappy?  Let's talk about something else."

>ask lucian about little old lady
"Yeah.  She died."  The sour taste in the air is almost overwhelmed by a different, marshy sort of smell, yet you somehow know that the two sensations are somehow related.  Ava is instantly consoling Lucian, and finding all the right words that you can't think of.

"Was she a gardener?" asks Ava.  "That's a beautiful garden she's in."

"Yeah, yeah she was.  She was an environmentalist.  That's why she...."  Lucian stops.  "Never mind."

1. "Why what?"

>[I love the characterization of Ava. Bravo]
I didn't understand that sentence.

>[I would like to see Daniel evolve into a really high-EQ guy due to this experience, in later games]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

"Why what?"

Lucian shakes his head.  Stacy looks a little annoyed and says, "you know, if you don't tell us what's upsetting you, we can't help you.  So why don't you just spit it out and get it over with?"

Lucian looks a little angry and says, "stop picking on me!  You're just like those bullies at dinner!  They made me give them my grandmother's earth crystal and I bet you want me to pay some sort of fine for being a loser.  Well I've had it.  Just go away and leave me alone!"

>ask lucian about crystal
"It's a crystal cube with a 3-D image of the earth etched inside it.  My grandmother gave it to me just before she died, so it means a lot to me.  Those bullies didn't care, though, they just took it.  I don't know how to get it back, I mean, I don't want to go crying to the camp counselors like a little crybaby."  Lucian sniffles and wipes his sleeve across his nose, then reaches over to the CD player to turn the volume up. 

"Isn't it loud enough for you already?" asks Stacy pointedly.  "It's not even a very good song!  Ava says it makes her sick."

Ava turns bright red.  "Only because I had to sing it in my voice lessons over and over again," she says quickly. 

Lucian shrugs.  "I just like the song.  It makes me feel better when I'm feeling unhappy."

1. "Are you feeling very unhappy?"
2. "It's a nice song...."

[You achieved a goal! (find out what happened to Lucian)]

>[hey, I'm having an idea about this song. Maybe we don't ever have to identify it. Just describe it as something like "a song you recognize but can't quite identify. It was popular a few years ago." Or some such.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[Ava is the only one who really needs to know it, and this description neatly affirms that she does.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

"It's a nice song...."

"It was my grandmother's favourite song.  She used to sing it to me when I was little."  Lucian's glance strays to one of the photographs on his desk, of an old lady in her garden.

Stacy pulls you and Ava aside.  "Okay," she says, "I think I know how to fix this.  We've got to get that earth crystal away from the bullies and give it back to Lucian here.  Daniel, I think we should let you handle this part.  You can track them from the info desk the same way you tracked Lucian."

[A new goal was added: retrieve Lucian's crystal]

>[Okay, popular more than a few years ago. But you get the idea.]

Pits West
This end of the Pits hallway is somewhat less spooky than the rest: the paper skeletons dancing across the walls all seem quite cheerful and not at all threatening.  Dim light filters in through a high window, through which you can see the bushes and assorted shrubbery growing up against the building.  From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.

You can see your friends Ava and Stacy here.

Pits Stairwell
This is the Pits, and evidently someone thought it would be a good idea to decorate the area dedicated to housing newbies with images taken from classic horror movies.  Frankenstein's monster looms over the doorway to the south, as if standing guard outside the Pits Lobby, while werewolves and vampires romp away to the east and west.  The stairs themselves lead back upstairs to the wintery delights of the first floor.

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

>focus
You close your eyes and stand near the door to Calvin Field.  You know Lucian's trail begins just outside this door.  Concentrating on the area in question, you sense the beginning of another trail, one that smells of burnt engine oil and sounds like a monkey's chatter dropped several octaves and sped up.  It traces the same path back towards the dorms to the north.

You can trace that unpleasant smell, and its accompanying sound, to one of the rooms to the south.  The door is open on an already messy room, and with a shock you realise that you are not sensing that burnt-oil smell with your nose at all: it's just registering in your mind as a smell.  Same goes for the sound of low-pitched chattering. 

One of the boys inside the room notices you gawking outside the door, and comes out.  "Yeah, what do you want?"

1. "Uh.  Nothing in particular...."
2. "I was following this, uh, smell, and I was wondering...."
3. "Um, Have you seen an earth crystal -- sort of like a glass cube, about so big, with the earth etched inside...?"

"Hey, Joe, did we give loserboy permission to enter our room?"

"Why no, Hank, I don't believe we did.  Maybe we'll have to make him pay a fine."

"Aw, but that would be mean!  We shouldn't make little loserboys give us stuff for trespassing.  I think we should punish them instead."

3. "What do you mean, 'punish them'?"

Joe smirks.  "It's yours if you can take us both in a fair fight with both hands tied behind you and a blindfold on."

3. "It's not yours to begin with!"

We just had our first class on old-school text adventures today, and I'm kind of caught up in the homework.  Seriously, this is kind of cool."  Turning back to his laptop, he begins typing away.

Aidan's Room
Aidan shares this room with some guy whose name you never caught and whom you almost never see.  Aidan keeps his half of the room neat and spartan, almost as if he were expecting a military inspection at any moment.  The bedclothes look to be pulled tight enough to bounce a penny to the ceiling, and the desk is practically bare but for a few neatly regulationed necessities.  The door to the dorm corridor is back to the south.

"Yo, Hank!  Joe!"  Aidan strides into the bullies' room as if he owned the place and perches on the edge of a desk.  "I hear you've been bothering the younger campers again."

Hank looks out the door, sees you, and gives you the evil eye.  "So?"

"So I figure you gotta either pay a fine or get yourselves ratted out to the counselors.  Me, I don't like ratting on people, so I figure it's gonna be the fine for you guys."  He picks up the earth crystal.  "This will do nicely, especially since I gather you took it from one of the younger campers to begin with."

"Shove off, Aidan.  Unless you want a mouthful of knuckles."

Aidan gives a short bark of laughter.  "Dude.  My dad chews out Navy SEALs for a living, remember?  They taught me how to kill jerks like you with a pencil when I was five."  Catching Hank glaring out the door at you, he adds, "that's my little brother, in case you're wondering.  Only reason he hasn't whupped your sorry asses to hell and back is because he takes the whole 'only pick on people who can fight back' thing a lot more seriously than I do."

Joe looks like he's about to call Aidan's bluff, but Aidan stares him down.  The two bullies finally look away, muttering something rude.  Aidan swaggers out of the room and pulls the door shut behind him.  He grins and passes the earth crystal to you.  "There you go.  Problem solved.  Now, I better get back to Zork."

Lucian looks up from his desk as you enter the room, and his mouth drops open when he sees the earth crystal in your hands.  "You did it!  You got it back!"  He leaps from his chair and throws his arms around you -- the room glows mauve for an instant, and something stabs in the back of your eye.  You vaguely hear Stacy telling Lucian to take it easy, and you feel Ava's arms catching you as you stumble back, off-balance, from Lucian.

"I don't know if we're any closer to figuring out what's going on," you say to the girls as you leave Lucian's room.  "I mean, so now I'm some sort of psychic bloodhound?  Why me?"

"It could turn out useful," says Stacy.  "Just think of the things you could do now!"

Ava doesn't say anything.  She just looks worried.

The headaches are now nothing more than a faint but constant pressure in the back of your skull.  The dizzy spells are gone, and in their place is a vague sense of unease.  The last time you felt perfectly normal would have to be shortly before falling asleep last night.

If you concentrate even a little bit, you can conjure up those unreal sensations around everybody you meet.  And you're beginning to notice a definite relationship between what you sense and how everybody feels.  This is definitely some sort of empathic thing that's waking up inside you.  You'll have to discuss this with Ava and Stacy and Aidan later tonight.

LEAP, Day 4 (Wednesday) - Dinner

You usually have your meals with Ava and Stacy, but they're in a different time slot for dinner today.  Aidan's with his own friends at the other end of the dining hall, which leaves you alone with your readings for your class on satirical writing.  Hopefully Aristophanes and Moliere will be enough to distract you from the rather unpleasant substances on your plate pretending to be meat and potatoes.

Dining Hall
The dining hall is a large room lined with long tables and chairs.  It is crowded with campers discussing just about everything under the sun.

You are alone at the southeast corner of the room, with a few readings for your satirical writing class.  You can see Aidan somewhere off to the west, eating with his friends.

Lucian's eyes light up.  "I knew you were different from the others!"  He goes on about his delight at making a friend, but you can't hear him: you've been nearly bowled out of your seat by a wall of fluttering mauve butterfly wings exploding from Lucian.  You fight to regain your balance, but the explosion of color drives you reeling away from the table.  All around you, colors and sounds and smells and flavours and disconcerting sensations thrilling along your skin all erupt into being, leaving you unable to see what's actually there.  You are vaguely aware of Aidan, somewhere off to the west, getting to his feet before you lose him to a complicated flurry of woodwinds.

You are lost in a swirl of sensory stimuli. The west feels electrically charged, you can almost hear the buzz. 

Somewhere off to the west, above the noise and color and inexplicable smells, you think you hear something -- a low-pitched reed instrument of some kind, possibly an oboe -- calling out to you.

You finally stumble into the edge of what looks like a long, sustained note played on an oboe and sounds like a cone of bright, white light.  It leaps about you, and you feel someone catch hold of you -- it takes you a moment to realise that this is real, and not a product of your out-of-control senses.  It's Aidan, you can hear his voice over the buzzing of all the other sounds that aren't really there.  The relief is overwhelming, and you finally allow yourself to collapse.

[You achieved a goal! (find your way to Aidan)]

Just as you lose consciousness, you are startled by the appearance of something ominously black and alien, spinning about in the centre of the whiteness surrounding you....


Please press SPACE to continue.

The first thing you try to do when you regain consciousness is open your eyes.  This fails because they're already open.  You're in absolute darkness, and there's this smell -- not that you can really trust your senses anymore -- like disinfectant.

Rather more alarmingly, for some odd reason, is the fact that you feel perfectly fine.  When was the last time you felt that way?

The top of the coffin flies open, and you're momentarily blinded by a flood of bright light.  As you try to blink away the spots, a face swims into view -- it takes you a few moments to register the curly white hair, the rosy cheeks and the clear blue eyes, and the fact that said face is talking to you.

Hospital Room
You are in a hospital room, equipped with a single bizarre-looking coffin-case thing attached to a bewildering wall of medical equipment.  The walls are painted a sterile white.  Huge windows look out to the south, while a pale green door, equipped with a small viewing window, is to the north.

[placeholder text: "Room description text about the doctor."]

You can see a coffin case (empty) here.

"Hullo, Daniel.  My goodness, you gave us a scare.  How are you feeling?"

1. "I'm alive, I think."
2. "What just happened?"
3. "What the hell just happened?"
4. "I just woke up in a coffin!  I thought I was being buried alive!  How do you think I feel?"

>[again, there shouldn't be any text that assumes D knows he's in a coffin]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[also, I think I'm sitting up inside the coffin. It's not empty.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

"What just happened?"

"Now, then, that's a rather complicated question.  Let's see if I can make the answer a little less complicated."  The face pauses thoughtfully before continuing.

"Here, sit up.  I'm Dr Claudia Rose, by the way, and you and your brother are very lucky that your particular condition happens to be a specialty of mine."

1. "Condition?  What condition?"
2. "What... has something happened to Aidan?"

>[or I guess that I'm not even sitting up yet]
I didn't understand that sentence.

>[to clarify my earlier statement: there shouldn't be a reference to the coffin before the text "bizarre-looking coffin-case thing"]
I didn't understand that sentence.

"What... has something happened to Aidan?"

"Your brother Aidan carried you here after you collapsed at dinner last night."  Dr Rose pauses.  "A distance of about a mile, running at 30 miles an hour, he was here before anyone at the camp could fully explain over the phone what had happened."

1. "Where is he?  I want to see him."
2. "So what DID happen?"

>2
"So what DID happen?"

"What happened at dinner was a sensory overload.  Too many people, too many emotions, not enough experience.  You should develop the ability to handle this sort of thing, with time, but in the meantime it is absolutely vital that you come back here once a week for ... well, this device here."  Dr Rose waves a hand at what appears to be a steampunk salon hair dryer.  "This is a cranial crown that will flood your brain with an electromagnetic frequency that should dampen the new sensory stimulus going to your brain -- giving it a rest, as it were -- and prevent it from going out of control again."

1. "It's not going to also give me a hair helmet, is it?"
2. "Well, that's a drag.  I suppose there's nothing I can do about it, is there?"

>[there should be an option here along the lines of, "But I don't understand. What's happening to me? Why am I suddenly feeling everybody's feelings? Or smelling them, or whatever?"]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>2
"Well, that's a drag.  I suppose there's nothing I can do about it, is there?"

"Your friends tell me you've been able to track people using the emotional debris they leave in their wake.  That's really quite impressive.  You should also be able to get an idea of how a person feels by examining them, and possibly more if you focus on those emotions.  Eventually, I think you might even be able to amplify or muffle whatever emotion you find, though right now that ability may only manifest in times of extreme stress, as it was with the manifestation of Aidan's abilities."

1. "Can I see Aidan?"
2. "I guess that sort of went out of control at dinner...."

>focus
[placeholder text: "You sense nothing untoward or out of the ordinary here."]

>focus on rose
I only understood you as far as wanting to focus.

>feel rose

"Can I see Aidan?"

"Your conditions are quite delicate, Daniel, and I don't want you to experience a relapse or anything of the sort.  The exertion may be too much, and I don't want you to excite yourself.  So please stay in your room, refrain from exerting yourself, and wait until I'm sure that your condition is stable."

"I have spoken to your parents, by the way, and explained everything to them.  As you know, they're overseas and cannot return at the moment, at least not on such short notice.  In the meantime, they've left me in charge of your health and welfare.  So, Daniel, if anything bothers you at all, I hope you will tell me about it.  I'll do anything I can to make sure you're safe."

Dr Rose pats you on the shoulder and is about to say something more when there's a resounding crash from somewhere else in the hospital.  At the same time, the pager on Dr Rose's belt goes off.  You catch a glimpse of a number, R15, flashing on its face as Dr Rose looks down at it.  She frowns.  "I'm sorry to have to cut our little chat short, Daniel, but it seems I'm urgently needed elsewhere.  Remember, stay where you are, and don't exert yourself."  With that, she hurries out of the room, leaving a cloud of apprehension (or is it anxiety?) in her wake.

As the door closes behind her, Ava and Stacy slip into the room.  "Daniel!" says Ava, "what happened?  Are you going to be okay?"

"Ava, stop worrying and let him answer already."  Stacy's eye wanders over to the cranial crown contraption.  You don't need super emo-detector powers to see that her curiosity is piqued.

>[I kind of think there should be something in D's room that prompts about parents. Maybe a pic of them whose description could give a precis of who they are, where they are, and why. Otherwise that "as you know" is quite jarring.]

>ask stacy about crown
You tell Stacy about the cranial crown and the need for regular treatments.  "Sorry to hear that," Stacy says, still peering at the cranial crown and not sounding very convincing, "that sort of thing always sucks."

>x stacy

(first opening the door to R15)
Looking through the window, you see a room equipped in much the same way your room was, complete with the silvery, high-tech coffin thing.  That's where the resemblance ends.  The lid of the coffin thing has been broken off and lies at the far end of the room, a huge crack down its middle, and smoke billows out from one broken monitor.  Aidan himself is lying near the coffin, unconscious, while a bunch of orderlies stand at a very safe distance away from him.

Fear, shock, whatever, it's thick in the air and feels like you just snorted hot salsa up your nose.

In the middle of all this is Dr Rose.  You can't hear what she's saying but ... oh, well, it looks like she's done lecturing the orderlies and now she's heading for the door.  You pull back before she sees you.  You've got to get back to your room before she notices you're gone, but you're in a corner and there's no way to know which way she'll turn when she comes out, and if you hide in the empty room to the west Dr Rose will almost certainly get to your room before you.

"Go that way," Stacy whispers, shoving you eastwards.  "I'll distract them."  Before you can say anything, Stacy has run off to the south.
