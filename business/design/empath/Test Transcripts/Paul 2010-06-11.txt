Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  

Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. 

>x taste
[placeholder text: "It's here, but you'll really need to focus on it."]



>focus on taste
You sense nothing untoward or out of the ordinary here.

>[whoops! That really needs to work -- false negatives around the game's primary nonstandard verb are a definite danger zone, as they discourage players from the main leap they need to make.]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>focus
Concentrating on the flavor, you sense an undercurrent of something salty as well, like tears.  You can also tell that this is all definitely part of a trail of some sort, going off to the east and the north. 

>n

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.

First Floor Lobby, East
This used to be a rather large dining room, once upon a time, and it still has a low-hanging chandelier right in the middle of the ceiling.  A piano's been pushed under the chandelier so that nobody accidentally gets a head full of crystal walking blindly around, and the place is generally used as a kind of music room now.  The info desk is back to the northwest, and to the west is the rest of the first floor lobby.  Wide picture windows look out on the front lawn and on the southern part of Calvin Field. A group of older kids seem to be discussing the psychology of cats in one corner.

Ava says it's a baby grand, and she knows more about this sort of thing.  All grand pianos seem more or less alike to you.  The pile of plastic dinosaurs under the piano probably makes it unique, however.

Rarrr.  They're all very lifelike, despite being small, plastic, and a variety of colors unlikely to be found in nature.

>x dinosaur
You can't really get more generic, as far as dinosaurs go, as a diplodocus.  Never mind that there were thousands of other species of giant lizards roaming the earth once upon a time.  The purple color of this little plastic diplodocus is probably an example of artistic license, however.

First Floor Lobby, West
This used to be the living room, back when old AQJ was still alive and the university was just starting up.  It's got a huge fireplace, and a big bay window looking out onto the front lawn.  It's also been painted completely white from floor to ceiling, so thickly that you're not sure if some of the molding is not actually just bubbles under the paint.  The info desk is back through the arch to the north, and the lobby continues, through another arch, to the west.

A large brass plaque has been fixed into the space over the fireplace.

Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. 

>x plaque
It's shaped like a shield, and commemorates the memory of Damon Rose, one of the founders of LEAP.  You remember him quite well from last year.  It was quite a shock to hear about the accident, and there was some question as to whether LEAP could go on without him.  His sister, Claudia Rose, is in charge of LEAP now, and making sure that the good work goes on.  She seems like a nice lady, but she's just not quite as present as old Damon Rose used to be.

Pits Stairwell
This is the Pits, and evidently someone thought it would be a good idea to decorate the area dedicated to housing newbies with images taken from classic horror movies.  Frankenstein's monster looms over the doorway to the south, as if standing guard outside the Pits lobby, while werewolves and vampires romp away to the east and west.  The stairs themselves lead back upstairs to the wintery delights of the first floor.

Pits, East
Your room is at this end of the Pits hallway, just to the south of here.  You've elected to cover your door with the biggest cutout of a werewolf that you can find, because werewolves are cool.  The hallway continues west, and a high window on the east wall looks out across Calvin Field North.  Right beside your room door is the fire stair leading back upstairs.

Pits Lobby Central
This section of the Pits is part of the older part of Jacobs Hall, and therefore cut up into more interesting shapes.  There are a bunch of storerooms, all of them locked, and then two very large halls to the east and west.  A passage to the north leads back to the main stairwell.  Apparently there used to be another staircase here going up, but it was ripped out to give this place a little more elbow room.

Pits, West
This end of the Pits hallway is somewhat less spooky than the rest: the paper skeletons dancing across the walls all seem quite cheerful and not at all threatening.  Dim light filters in through a high window, through which you can see the bushes and assorted shrubbery growing up against the building.  From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.

There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.

Concentrating on the flavor, you sense an undercurrent of salt tears.  They trail off to the east, but seem strongest around one of the doors to the south. 

"Whatever it is, it's strongest around that door."

Ava and Stacy exchange glances, and before you can stop her, Stacy is knocking on the door.  "We've come this far.  I want to know what's at the end of --"

Stacy quickly shuts up when the door opens a crack, and a rather timid little guy peeks out at you.  He fairly reeks of that mysterious sour-salty air.  And now you think you can hear some sort of twittering in the background, too.  It occurs to you that you remember seeing him up at the egg-drop option yesterday, though he certainly wasn't giving off this... whatever it is... back then.

"Hi," says Ava, who seems to recognize the guy.  "Lucian, isn't it?  We met yesterday at the sign-ups.  Anyway, these are my friends Daniel and Stacy.  May we come in for a moment?"

Lucian lets the door swing half-open and sighs resignedly.  "Sure, if you want," he says, retreating back into the room.  The three of you follow him inside.

Lucian's Room
It's another dorm room, not much different from your own.  Lucian's desk and bed are on one side; a CD player, playing Bill Withers' "Lean On Me" over and over, sits on his desk beside a couple of framed photographs.

There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.

There are two of them.  One appears to be a class photograph taken a year or two ago: there's an older man, maybe in his fifties, surrounded by a bunch of kids, in front of a blackboard.  The other is much older, judging by the clothes and hair, and shows a cheerful little old lady sitting on a bench in a colorful flower garden.

(Lucian's photographs)
You look at the two photographs.  There's one of a little old lady in a garden.  The other is a class photograph.

1. "Is that your class picture?  What was your teacher like?"
2. "Who's the lady in that picture?  Is she your grandmother?"


>2
"Who's the lady in that picture?  Is she your grandmother?"

"Yeah.  She died."  The sour taste in the air is almost overwhelmed by a different, marshy sort of smell, yet you somehow know that the two sensations are somehow related.  Ava is instantly consoling Lucian, and finding all the right words that you can't think of.

"Was she a gardener?" asks Ava.  "That's a beautiful garden she's in."

"Yeah, yeah she was.  She was an environmentalist.  That's why she...."  Lucian stops.  "Never mind."

1. "Why what?"

>1
"Why what?"

Lucian shakes his head.  Stacy looks a little annoyed and says, "you know, if you don't tell us what's upsetting you, we can't help you.  So why don't you just spit it out and get it over with?"

Lucian looks a little angry and says, "Stop picking on me!  You're just like those bullies at dinner!  They made me give them my grandmother's earth crystal and I bet you want me to pay some sort of fine for being a loser.  Well I've had it.  Just go away and leave me alone!"

>ask lucian about crystal
"It's a crystal cube with a 3-D image of the earth etched inside it.  My grandmother gave it to me just before she died, so it means a lot to me.  Those bullies didn't care, though, they just took it.  I don't know how to get it back, I mean, I don't want to go crying to the camp counselors like a little crybaby."  Lucian sniffles and wipes his sleeve across his nose, then reaches over to the CD player to turn the volume up.

"Isn't it loud enough for you already?" asks Stacy pointedly.  "It's not even a very good song!  Ava says it makes her sick."

Ava turns bright red.  "Only because I had to sing it in my voice lessons over and over again," she says quickly.

Lucian shrugs.  "I just like the song.  It makes me feel better when I'm feeling unhappy."

1. "Are you feeling very unhappy?"
2. "It's a nice song...."


[A new goal was added: retrieve Lucian's crystal]

Now that you think about it, there are so many alien sensations swirling around, most of them so faint you're not sure if you're just imagining them.  You really don't know which sensation you really want.

Stacy pulls you and Ava aside.  "Okay," she says, "I think I know how to fix this.  We've got to get that earth crystal away from the bullies and give it back to Lucian here.  Daniel, I think we should let you handle this part.  You can track them from the info desk the same way you tracked Lucian."

"He lets us call him by his first name, and he's the most awesome teacher ever."  Then Lucian looks sad again.  "He's the one who said I was smart enough to come here, and he went and pulled all sorts of strings.  I should be grateful, I suppose."

You close your eyes and stand near the door to Calvin Field.  You know Lucian's trail begins just outside this door.  Concentrating on the area in question, you sense the beginning of another trail, one that smells of burnt engine oil and sounds like a monkey's chatter dropped several octaves and sped up.  It traces the same path back towards the dorms to the north. 

>["back towards the dorms to the north?" This description seems slightly off. We're inside the dorm, facing east.]

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

Some sort of oily, burnt stench seems to coil about your legs here, and you think you can hear some sort of low-pitched chatter.

First Floor Rooms, East
This is the east end of the first floor dorm area.  Through the window at the end of the hall, you can see Calvin Field North and a bunch of campers running about in the summer sunshine.

You can trace that unpleasant smell, and its accompanying sound, to one of the rooms to the south.  The door is open on an already messy room, and with a shock you realize that you are not sensing that burnt-oil smell with your nose at all: it's just registering in your mind as a smell.  Same goes for the sound of low-pitched chattering. 

One of the boys inside the room notices you gawking outside the door, and comes out.  "Yeah, what do you want?"

1. "Uh.  Nothing in particular...."
2. "I was following this, uh, smell, and I was wondering...."
3. "Um, Have you seen an earth crystal -- sort of like a glass cube, about so big, with the earth etched inside...?"

Aidan isn't in right now, and you shouldn't be poking around in his room while he's gone.  Even if he is your brother.  Especially if he's your brother.  And anyway, the door is locked.

Aidan opens the door.  "Hey, Daniel!  What's up?"  He ushers you into the room and sits down at his desk.  "Sorry if I'm a little distracted.  We just had our first class on old-school text adventures today, and I'm kind of caught up in the homework.  Seriously, this is kind of cool."  Turning back to his laptop, he begins typing away.

Aidan shares this room with some guy whose name you never caught and whom you almost never see.  Aidan keeps his half of the room neat and spartan, almost as if he were expecting a military inspection at any moment.  The bedclothes look to be pulled tight enough to bounce a penny to the ceiling, and the desk is practically bare but for a few neatly regulationed necessities.  The door to the dorm corridor is back to the south.

Aidan is sitting at his desk, clearly in the middle of a computer game of some sort.

Hank looks out the door, sees you, and gives you the evil eye.  "So?"

"So I figure you gotta either pay a fine or get yourselves ratted out to the counselors.  Me, I don't like ratting on people, so I figure it's gonna be the fine for you guys."  He picks up the earth crystal.  "This will do nicely, especially since I gather you took it from one of the younger campers to begin with."

"Shove off, Aidan.  Unless you want a mouthful of knuckles."

Aidan gives a short bark of laughter.  "Dude.  My dad chews out Navy SEALs for a living, remember?  They taught me how to kill jerks like you with a pencil when I was five."  Catching Hank glaring out the door at you, he adds, "That's my little brother, in case you're wondering.  Only reason he hasn't whooped your sorry asses to hell and back is because he takes the whole 'only pick on people who can fight back' thing a lot more seriously than I do."

Joe looks like he's about to call Aidan's bluff, but Aidan stares him down.  The two bullies finally look away, muttering something rude.  Aidan swaggers out of the room and pulls the door shut behind him.  He grins and passes the earth crystal to you.  "There you go.  Problem solved.  Now, I better get back to Zork."  He musses up your hair and strolls back to his room.

[You achieved a goal! (give Lucian back his crystal)]

Lucian looks up from his desk as you enter the room, and his mouth drops open when he sees the earth crystal in your hands.  "You did it!  You got it back!"  He leaps from his chair and throws his arms around you -- the room glows mauve for an instant, and something stabs in the back of your eye.  You vaguely hear Stacy telling Lucian to take it easy, and you feel Ava's arms catching you as you stumble back, off-balance, from Lucian.

"I don't know if we're any closer to figuring out what's going on," you say to the girls as you leave Lucian's room.  "I mean, so now I'm some sort of psychic bloodhound?  Why me?"

"It could turn out useful," says Stacy.  "Just think of the things you could do now!"

Ava doesn't say anything.  She just looks worried.

The headaches are now nothing more than a faint but constant pressure in the back of your skull.  The dizzy spells are gone, and in their place is a vague sense of unease.  The last time you felt perfectly normal would have to be shortly before falling asleep last night.

If you concentrate even a little bit, you can conjure up those unreal sensations around everybody you meet.  And you're beginning to notice a definite relationship between what you sense and how everybody feels.  This is definitely some sort of empathic thing that's waking up inside you.  You'll have to discuss this with Ava and Stacy and Aidan later tonight.

LEAP, Day 4 (Wednesday) - Dinner

You usually have your meals with Ava and Stacy, but they're in a different time slot for dinner today.  Aidan's with his own friends at the other end of the dining hall, which leaves you alone with your readings for your class on satirical writing.  Hopefully Aristophanes and Moliere will be enough to distract you from the rather unpleasant substances on your plate pretending to be meat and potatoes.

Dining Hall
You are alone at the southeast corner of the room, with a few readings for your satirical writing class.  You can see Aidan somewhere off to the west, eating with his friends.

"Really?  You're so cool!  Hey, I don't know what you said to those bullies yesterday, but you have to tell me how you did it!  Is there a special class for dealing with bullies?  They have all sorts of classes here... hey, maybe you could teach me!"

1. "I'm sorta busy tonight...."

Lucian's eyes light up.  "I knew you were different from the others!"  He goes on about his delight at making a friend, but you can't hear him: you've been nearly bowled out of your seat by a wall of fluttering mauve butterfly wings exploding from Lucian.  You fight to regain your balance, but the explosion of color drives you reeling away from the table.  All around you, colors and sounds and smells and flavors and disconcerting sensations thrilling along your skin all erupt into being, leaving you unable to see what's actually there.  You are vaguely aware of Aidan, somewhere off to the west, getting to his feet before you lose him to a complicated flurry of woodwinds.

Somewhere off to the west, above the noise and color and inexplicable smells, you think you hear something -- a low-pitched reed instrument of some kind, possibly an oboe -- calling out to you.

You finally stumble into the edge of what looks like a long, sustained note played on an oboe and sounds like a cone of bright, white light.  It leaps about you, and you feel someone catch hold of you -- it takes you a moment to realize that this is real, and not a product of your out-of-control senses.  It's Aidan, you can hear his voice over the buzzing of all the other sounds that aren't really there.  The relief is overwhelming, and you finally allow yourself to collapse.

[You achieved a goal! (find your way to Aidan)]

Rather more alarmingly, for some odd reason, is the fact that you feel perfectly fine.  When was the last time you felt that way?

The darkness above you flies open, and you're momentarily blinded by a flood of bright light.  As you try to blink away the spots, a face swims into view -- it takes you a few moments to register the curly white hair, the rosy cheeks and the clear blue eyes, and the fact that said face is talking to you.

"Hullo, Daniel.  My goodness, you gave us a scare.  How are you feeling?"

1. "I'm alive, I think."

3. "What the hell just happened?"

"You're in the university hospital, dear, and I'm Dr Claudia Rose.  We've had you and your brother under observation all night, and I really hope you'll both be well enough to return to the camp today.  You should be, if nothing goes wrong."

"Your brother Aidan carried you here after you collapsed at dinner last night."  Dr Rose pauses.  "A distance of about a mile, running at thirty miles an hour, he was here before anyone at the camp could fully explain over the phone what had happened."

1. "Where is he?  I want to see him."
2. "So what DID happen?"

>2
"So what DID happen?"

"What happened at dinner was a sensory overload.  Too many people, too many emotions, not enough experience.  You should develop the ability to handle this sort of thing, with time, but in the meantime it is absolutely vital that you come back here once a week for ... well, this device here."  Dr Rose waves a hand at what appears to be a steampunk salon hair dryer.  "This is a cranial crown that will flood your brain with an electromagnetic frequency that should dampen the new sensory stimulus going to your brain -- giving it a rest, as it were -- and prevent it from going out of control again."

1. "It's not going to also give me a hair helmet, is it?"
2. "Well, that's a drag.  I suppose there's nothing I can do about it, is there?"

Your Hospital Room
You are in a hospital room, equipped with a single bizarre-looking coffin-case thing attached to a bewildering wall of medical equipment.  The walls are painted a sterile white.  Huge windows look out to the south, while a pale green door, equipped with a small viewing window, is to the north.

Northwest Corner Of Hospital
The corridor makes a bend here, going east and south.  There are hospital rooms to the west and north, although the sounds coming from the north suggest that that particular hospital room is not quite as empty as all the others have been.

You can see a door to R15 here.

>n
Looking through the window, you see a room equipped in much the same way your room was, complete with the silvery, high-tech coffin thing.  That's where the resemblance ends.  The lid of the coffin thing has been broken off and lies at the far end of the room, a huge crack down its middle, and smoke billows out from one broken monitor.  Aidan himself is lying near the coffin, unconscious, while a bunch of orderlies stand at a very safe distance away from him.

Fear, shock, whatever, it's thick in the air and feels like you just snorted hot salsa up your nose.

In the middle of all this is Dr Rose.  You can't hear what she's saying but ... oh, well, it looks like she's done lecturing the orderlies and now she's heading for the door.  You pull back before she sees you.  You've got to get back to your room before she notices you're gone, but you're in a corner and there's no way to know which way she'll turn when she comes out, and if you hide in the empty room to the west Dr Rose will almost certainly get to your room before you.

"Go that way," Stacy whispers, shoving you eastwards.  "I'll distract them."  Before you can say anything, Stacy has run off to the south.

>[okay, clearly this chapter just flat-out broke when that bug showed up. And I don't think I've saved for a while. I'll get myself back to this point and call it a night.]

First Floor Rooms, West
You're at the west end of the first floor dorm area.  The winter sports theme continues on in spite of the summer sunshine streaming in through the window.  Aidan's room is to the north, flanked by a pair of matching hockey sticks, and you could take the fire stairs up or down.

Stacy trails along behind you.

Pits, West
This end of the Pits hallway is somewhat less spooky than the rest: the paper skeletons dancing across the walls all seem quite cheerful and not at all threatening.  Dim light filters in through a high window, through which you can see the bushes and assorted shrubbery growing up against the building.  From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.

Stacy trails along behind you. 

>s

Lucian's Room
It's another dorm room, not much different from your own.  Lucian's desk and bed are on one side; a CD player, playing Bill Withers' "Lean On Me" over and over, sits on his desk beside a couple of framed photographs.

Stacy trails along behind you. 

Ava and Stacy are here.

[placeholder text: "Room description text about Lucian"]

.

[You achieved a goal! (give Lucian back his crystal)]

Lucian looks up from his desk as you enter the room, and his mouth drops open when he sees the earth crystal in your hands.  "You did it!  You got it back!"  He leaps from his chair and throws his arms around you -- the room glows mauve for an instant, and something stabs in the back of your eye.  You vaguely hear Stacy telling Lucian to take it easy, and you feel Ava's arms catching you as you stumble back, off-balance, from Lucian.

"I don't know if we're any closer to figuring out what's going on," you say to the girls as you leave Lucian's room.  "I mean, so now I'm some sort of psychic bloodhound?  Why me?"

"It could turn out useful," says Stacy.  "Just think of the things you could do now!"

Ava doesn't say anything.  She just looks worried.



Please press SPACE to continue.

The headaches are now nothing more than a faint but constant pressure in the back of your skull.  The dizzy spells are gone, and in their place is a vague sense of unease.  The last time you felt perfectly normal would have to be shortly before falling asleep last night.

If you concentrate even a little bit, you can conjure up those unreal sensations around everybody you meet.  And you're beginning to notice a definite relationship between what you sense and how everybody feels.  This is definitely some sort of empathic thing that's waking up inside you.  You'll have to discuss this with Ava and Stacy and Aidan later tonight.

LEAP, Day 4 (Wednesday) - Dinner

You usually have your meals with Ava and Stacy, but they're in a different time slot for dinner today.  Aidan's with his own friends at the other end of the dining hall, which leaves you alone with your readings for your class on satirical writing.  Hopefully Aristophanes and Moliere will be enough to distract you from the rather unpleasant substances on your plate pretending to be meat and potatoes.

Dining Hall
You are alone at the southeast corner of the room, with a few readings for your satirical writing class.  You can see Aidan somewhere off to the west, eating with his friends.

[A new goal was added: eat dinner in peace]

>eat dinner
You shovel another forkful of your dinner into your mouth and swallow it as quickly as you can.  Unfortunately, you still don't quite manage to escape the aftertaste.

>x dinner
Seriously, the food's about the only downside to the LEAP camp.  It looks okay, but there's this sickly sweet aftertaste, like they used fake sugar in everything.

"Hi, Daniel!"  It's Lucian, looking a lot more chipper than he did yesterday.  "Hey, where are Ava and Stacy?  Are you sitting alone?  Can I sit with you?"

1. "Sure...."
2. "No."
3. "Uh...."

>1
"Sure...."

"Really?  You're so cool!  Hey, I don't know what you said to those bullies yesterday, but you have to tell me how you did it!  Is there a special class for dealing with bullies?  They have all sorts of classes here... hey, maybe you could teach me!"

1. "Uh...."
2. "Actually, I asked my brother Aidan...."
3. "You really need to settle down."
4. "There's nothing to teach."

>2
"Actually, I asked my brother Aidan...."

"Oh?  Who's he?  Nah, I still think you're the coolest.  Hey, we should hang out!  We can play checkers.  Do you play checkers?  I bet you're really good at it.  We can play tonight, during dorm time!  How about it, Daniel?  Will you come play checkers with me?"

1. "I'm sorta busy tonight...."
2. "For goodness' sakes, settle down!"
3. "No, you're really creeping me out here."
4. "Uh, sure, why not...."
5. "I love checkers!"

>2
"For goodness' sakes, settle down!"

"Peter, my teacher back in school, used to say the same thing.  I'm just happy to have made friends!  You ARE going to be my friend, right?"

1. "Are you out of your mind?"
2. "Friends ... uh, sure...."

>1
"Are you out of your mind?"

Lucian's eyes nearly fall out of their sockets.  "But... but... I thought we were going to be friends!"  You try to respond but at that moment you hear a little snicker from somewhere -- no doubt one of the other first-years of Lucian's acquaintance -- and Lucian, absolutely mortified, leaves his tray on the table and makes a break for the dining hall doors.  You try to stand but are knocked back into your seat by a wave of bitterness and a strange, slick feeling that makes your skin crawl.  The headache, which you thought was all but gone, throbs to life and the room seems to whirl into a maelstrom of sound and color and smell and flavor and touch.  You're vaguely aware of Aidan, somewhere off to the west, getting to his feet before he disappears into a complicated flurry of woodwinds.

You finally stumble into the edge of what looks like a long, sustained note played on an oboe and sounds like a cone of bright, white light.  It leaps about you, and you feel someone catch hold of you -- it takes you a moment to realize that this is real, and not a product of your out-of-control senses.  It's Aidan, you can hear his voice over the buzzing of all the other sounds that aren't really there.  The relief is overwhelming, and you finally allow yourself to collapse.

[You achieved a goal! (find your way to Aidan)]

Just as you lose consciousness, you are startled by the appearance of something ominously black and alien, spinning about in the centre of the whiteness surrounding you....


Please press SPACE to continue.

The first thing you try to do when you regain consciousness is open your eyes.  This fails because they're already open.  You're in absolute darkness, and there's this smell -- not that you can really trust your senses anymore -- like disinfectant.

Rather more alarmingly, for some odd reason, is the fact that you feel perfectly fine.  When was the last time you felt that way?
