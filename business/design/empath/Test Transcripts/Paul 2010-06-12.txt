Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

>x me
It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

>feel
You sense nothing untoward or out of the ordinary here.

>[hmmmm. I know that's normally a synonymn for "focus". In this case, though, I think when confronted with pitch darkness a natural thing to attempt is to feel around. I think there should be a response along the lines of "You feel solid walls on every side
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[of you, pressing close. It sure feels like a coffin, but one whose walls are smooth and cold."]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>knock
The coffin case isn't open.

>knock on case
You can't see any such thing.

>[hrm]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>scream
The darkness above you flies open, and you're momentarily blinded by a flood of bright light.  As you try to blink away the spots, a face swims into view -- it takes you a few moments to register the curly white hair, the rosy cheeks and the clear blue eyes, and the fact that said face is talking to you.

"Hullo, Daniel.  My goodness, you gave us a scare.  How are you feeling?"

1. "I'm alive, I think."
2. "What just happened?"
3. "What the hell just happened?"
4. "I just woke up in a coffin!  I thought I was being buried alive!  How do you think I feel?"

>4
"I just woke up in a coffin!  I thought I was being buried alive!  How do you think I feel?"

"Tsk tsk, I do know you're upset, but I do think it best if you try to calm down and consider that this sort of stress might be what put you here in the first place."

1. "Where am I?"
2. "Okay, fine, I'll calm down.  See?  All calmed down.  Now this had better be good."

>2
"Okay, fine, I'll calm down.  See?  All calmed down.  Now this had better be good."

"Here, sit up.  I'm Dr Claudia Rose, by the way, and you and your brother are very lucky that your particular condition happens to be a specialty of mine."

1. "Condition?  What condition?"
2. "What... has something happened to Aidan?"

>1
"Condition?  What condition?"

"You're developing some rather unique abilities, Daniel.  As far as I can tell, based on what your friends have told me, you are gaining the ability to sense the emotions of the people around you.  At the moment, your brain is trying to cope with the influx of these new senses and trying to interpret them using the template of the other five; before long, you should start recognizing emotions for what they are, rather than sensing them as flavors or colours or smells."

1. "So ... what, I'm going to be some sort of mind-reader?"
2. "So what DID happen at dinner?"
3. "So I've got to avoid people now or I'll wind up here again?"
4. "That sounds kind of cool, actually...."

>["flavors or colours" -- mix 'n' match british & american spellings]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>2
"So what DID happen at dinner?"

"What happened at dinner was a sensory overload.  Too many people, too many emotions, not enough experience.  You should develop the ability to handle this sort of thing, with time, but in the meantime it is absolutely vital that you come back here once a week for ... well, this device here."  Dr Rose waves a hand at what appears to be a steampunk salon hair dryer.  "This is a cranial crown that will flood your brain with an electromagnetic frequency that should dampen the new sensory stimulus going to your brain -- giving it a rest, as it were -- and prevent it from going out of control again."

1. "It's not going to also give me a hair helmet, is it?"
2. "Well, that's a drag.  I suppose there's nothing I can do about it, is there?"
3. "But I don't understand.  What's happening to me?"

>1
"It's not going to also give me a hair helmet, is it?"

"A hair helmet?"  Dr Rose looks at the cranial crown again.  "Oh!  I suppose it does rather look like a salon hair dryer, doesn't it?  Well, function before form, I suppose.  The important thing is that it will allow your abilities to develop without overwhelming you in the process."

1. "My abilities?"

>1
"My abilities?"

"Your friends tell me you've been able to track people using the emotional debris they leave in their wake.  That's really quite impressive.  You should also be able to get an idea of how a person feels by examining them, and possibly more if you focus on those emotions.  Eventually, I think you might even be able to amplify or muffle whatever emotion you find, though right now that ability may only manifest in times of extreme stress, as it was with the manifestation of Aidan's abilities."

1. "Aidan's abilities?  What do you mean?"
2. "Can I see Aidan?"
3. "I guess that sort of went out of control at dinner...."

>1
"Aidan's abilities?  What do you mean?"

"Your brother Aidan carried you here after you collapsed at dinner last night."  Dr Rose pauses.  "A distance of about a mile, running at thirty miles an hour, he was here before anyone at the camp could fully explain over the phone what had happened."

1. "Where is he?  I want to see him."
2. "So what DID happen?"

>1
"Where is he?  I want to see him."

"Your conditions are quite delicate, Daniel, and I don't want you to experience a relapse or anything of the sort.  The exertion may be too much, and I don't want you to excite yourself.  So please stay in your room, refrain from exerting yourself, and wait until I'm sure that your condition is stable."

"I have spoken to your parents, by the way, and explained everything to them.  As you know, they're overseas and cannot return at the moment, at least not on such short notice.  In the meantime, they've left me in charge of your health and welfare.  So, Daniel, if anything bothers you at all, I hope you will tell me about it.  I'll do anything I can to make sure you're safe."

Dr Rose pats you on the shoulder and is about to say something more when there's a resounding crash from somewhere else in the hospital.  At the same time, the pager on Dr Rose's belt goes off.  You catch a glimpse of a number, R15, flashing on its face as Dr Rose looks down at it.  She frowns.  "I'm sorry to have to cut our little chat short, Daniel, but it seems I'm urgently needed elsewhere.  Remember, stay where you are, and don't exert yourself."  With that, she hurries out of the room, leaving a cloud of apprehension (or is it anxiety?) in her wake.

As the door closes behind her, Ava and Stacy slip into the room.  "Daniel!" says Ava, "what happened?  Are you going to be okay?"

"Ava, stop worrying and let him answer already."  Stacy's eye wanders over to the cranial crown contraption.  You don't need super emo-detector powers to see that her curiosity is piqued.

>["what" in the 2nd to last line should be capitalized.]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>tell stacy about crown
There is no reply.

[You achieved a goal! (find out what's happened to you)]

>[that seems weirdly late]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>ask stacy about crown
You tell Stacy about the cranial crown and the need for regular treatments.  "Sorry to hear that," Stacy says, still peering at the cranial crown and not sounding very convincing, "that sort of thing always sucks." 



>[hmmm... "ask" got me the response I was expecting from "tell" -- in fact, it reads as if it interpreted "ask" as "tell".]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>tell ava about powers
"I don't know what to say, Daniel."  Ava shifts uncomfortably.  "It's like something out of a comic book."

>tell stacy about powers
"So you've got these super emo-powers now?  I think I'm jealous."  She isn't really, you know, but you somehow know that she finds the idea absolutely fascinating.

>get up
But you aren't in anything at the moment.

>[I still envision myself in the coffin this whole time.]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>l
Your Hospital Room
You are in a hospital room, equipped with a single bizarre-looking coffin-case thing attached to a bewildering wall of medical equipment.  The walls are painted a sterile white.  Huge windows look out to the south, while a pale green door, equipped with a small viewing window, is to the north.

Ava and Stacy are here.

>x case
It's shiny and silver and futuristic-looking, but still looks like a coffin.  Or an Egyptian sarcophagus.  Or an iron maiden.  You'd have to be out cold before you'd let anyone put you into that thing.

>x equipment
Monitors, wires, computers ... it's all quite dizzying and bewildering.  Is that a stereo amplifier?

>ask stacy about equipment
(the medical equipment)
She doesn't say anything.

>[she's probably have something to say about it]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>ask stacy about case
(the coffin case)
You tell Stacy about the cranial crown and the need for regular treatments.  "Sorry to hear that," Stacy says, still peering at the cranial crown and not sounding very convincing, "that sort of thing always sucks."

>[I'm trying to address ava]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x ava
You met Ava last year, here at LEAP.  She's a rosy-cheeked girl with long, brown pigtails; since last year, she's also acquired a pair of glasses that, she claims, make her look like a young Nana Mouskouri.

Your Hospital Room

Ava and Stacy are here.

>x windows
You can see your dorm from here!

>x window
Which do you mean, the huge window or the viewing window?

>huge
You can see your dorm from here!

>x viewing
It's a square of reinforced glass set into the middle of the door.  Through it, you can see a featureless hospital corridor.

>ask ava about aidan
(Aidan)
"Ava went to look in on him while we were waiting to see you," says Stacy.  "He's somewhere on this floor too, isn't he?"

"They wouldn't let me in to see him, either," Ava says, "and it's not as if anything had happened to him or anything.  He's in room R15."

1. "R15?  That's the number I saw flashing on Dr Rose's pager!"


>1
"R15?  That's the number I saw flashing on Dr Rose's pager!"

"Something must have happened," you say, "I'll bet it has something to do with that crash I heard ... I've got to see what's going on!"

"No, wait," Ava says, "you're supposed to be resting!"

1. "I'll rest after I've checked in on Aidan!"
2. "I feel fine!"
3. "I suppose you're right.  Someone will tell me if it's something to do with Aidan."

>2
"I feel fine!"

"Well you don't know that you actually are fine!"  Ava moves to block your way.

"I'd like to know what that noise was, too," Stacy says, "and, come on, aren't you the least bit concerned?  It might have something to do with Aidan!"

Ava looks anxious and uncertain, then finally backs down.  "Okay, fine, but we better not get caught."

Stacy opens the door, and you all slip out into the corridor.  Ava points off to the northwest.  "Aidan's room is that way."

South T-Intersection
You are in a featureless hospital corridor stretching from east to west.  Another corridor goes off to the north.  The door to your hospital room is to the south.

[That command asks to do something outside of play, so it can only make sense from you to me. The wandering orderly cannot be asked to do this.]

>[Okay, what's up with that bracketed statement?]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[Also, a couple of moves ago: it is weird to present a conversation tree with one option. I'm not vetoing it, but it struck me strange as a player.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>ask stacy about r15
She does not reply.[placeholder text: "That seems kind of rude and unfriendly. She should have a handful of default responses for topics she doesn't know."]



>n

Main Intersection
This is the heart of this particular wing of the hospital, with corridors running off in all four cardinal directions.

Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. 

>x rooms
Which do you mean, the first floor rooms west, the first floor rooms east, the second floor rooms west, the second floor rooms east, the third floor rooms west or the third floor rooms east?

>[?????]
You can't see such a thing.

>[Oh, it's referencing the dorms. Is this scoping thing an Inform 7 deal? I don't remember Inform 6 being quite so all-inclusive.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[anyway, what I was thinking is that when I'm looking for a specific room number in an unfamiliar building, I generally look at the room numbers around me, to get a sense of which direction is the right one. We should probably allow that in this scene.]

>n
You quickly duck into the empty hospital room.  After a few moments, when nothing happens, you creep back out again.

>e
The wandering orderly goes east door.

Northeast Corner Of Hospital
The corridor makes a bend here, going west and south.  There are hospital rooms, apparently empty, to the east and north.

Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. 

>["The wandering orderly goes east door"? This bit clearly needs to bake some more.]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>n
You quickly duck into the empty hospital room as an orderly comes out of the other room.  You wait until the footsteps fade away to the west before emerging again into the corridor.

>e
You quickly duck into the empty hospital room as an orderly approaches.  You wait until the footsteps fade away to the south before emerging again into the corridor.

>s
The wandering orderly goes east door.

East T-Intersection
You are in a featureless hospital corridor stretching north and south.  Another corridor goes off to the west.  A pair of elevator doors are set into the east wall.

Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. 

>ne
There are exits north (to Northeast Corner of hospital), east door, south and west (to the main intersection) from here.

>e
You open the door and run right into an orderly who, though surprised, is not too surprised to immediately sound the alarm.  Within seconds, Ava and Stacy have been bundled out of the hospital and you're locked into your room.  It's a couple of hours before Dr Rose comes back, frowning in a very concerned manner.

Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. 

Looking through the window, you see a room equipped in much the same way your room was, complete with the silvery, high-tech coffin thing.  That's where the resemblance ends.  The lid of the coffin thing has been broken off and lies at the far end of the room, a huge crack down its middle, and smoke billows out from one broken monitor.  Aidan himself is lying near the coffin, unconscious, while a bunch of orderlies stand at a very safe distance away from him.

Fear, shock, whatever, it's thick in the air and feels like you just snorted hot salsa up your nose.

In the middle of all this is Dr Rose.  You can't hear what she's saying but ... oh, well, it looks like she's done lecturing the orderlies and now she's heading for the door.  You pull back before she sees you.  You've got to get back to your room before she notices you're gone, but you're in a corner and there's no way to know which way she'll turn when she comes out, and if you hide in the empty room to the west Dr Rose will almost certainly get to your room before you.

"Go that way," Stacy whispers, shoving you eastwards.  "I'll distract them."  Before you can say anything, Stacy has run off to the south.

>[huh? What triggered this?]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>s

Southeast Corner Of Hospital
The corridor makes a bend here, going west and north.  There are hospital rooms, apparently empty, to the east and south.

Ava trails along behind you. 

Ava and Stacy are here.

"Daniel Wayne!" Dr Rose catches you by the collar and frowns, clearly disappointed.  "What are you doing out of your room?  Come on, back you go."  She marches you back to your room, where she proceeds to put you through a battery of seemingly unnecessary tests.  Pursing her lips as she reads the data scrolling by on the monitors, she says, 

    *** The story is over. ***

Ava trails along behind you. 

And not a moment too soon.  When Dr Rose comes bustling in, you are back in the coffin thing and Ava is sitting beside you, looking as if you'd just spent the past half hour talking about the weather.  Dr Rose frowns a bit when she checks the readouts on the various monitors, but no-one can look as innocent as Ava when she has to, and in the end Dr Rose decides that nothing suspicious has been going on after all.

Aidan, she says, is still undergoing observation of some kind, but you're free to go back to camp.  Brad picks you up after lunch (it turns out that the hospital food tastes just as nasty as the camp food) and you're back in time for your afternoon classes.  It's dinner time before Aidan is back at camp; and whatever it was that happened to him in the hospital, he either doesn't remember, or doesn't want to tell you.


Please press SPACE to continue.

Things settle down, more or less, over the next day or so.  People are trying very hard to not give you funny looks when they see you, which pretty much comes to the same thing, really.  Aidan's probably going through the same sort of thing too.  He's certainly rather a bit more moody than he used to be.

LEAP, Day 6 (Friday) - Class Period 2

Robotics class, the wave of the future, because everyone knows that some day we're going to have giant killer robots laying waste to downtown Tokyo or something like that, and it would be a good thing to know how to deal with them.  No-one's really capable of making a giant killer robot: right now, you're all just doing a basic project to program a robot to do a certain simple task.  Except Stacy, who seems to be dead set on making a midget killer robot she calls the "Stacy Alexander Robot Guy", or SARG for short.

Robotics Class
You sit at a table in a perfectly ordinary classroom, surrounded by electronic parts.  Antonia Long, your Robotics instructor, has been cornered elsewhere by students with issues, leaving you to your own electronic, robotic devices.  Stacy sits beside you with her own robot project, SARG, while Aidan is at another table with the older students.

Stacy is sitting beside you, completely absorbed in her project.

On your workbench are some programming logic blocks, all different colors: forest green, baby blue, magenta, mint green, golden, saffron, scarlet, hot pink, royal purple and copper-colored, your robot, a metal bowl (empty) and a wicker basket (in which are seven marbles).

            }

>x stacy
You met Stacy last year, here at LEAP.  She's a skinny blonde girl with freckles and rather prominent front teeth.  She likes playing with gadgets, and is so full of nervous energy she could probably swallow an elephant and not gain an ounce of weight.  She's also wearing a deerstalker cap with a completely inappropriate daisy stuck into one flap.

Aidan is your big brother.  He looks quite a lot like you, only taller and broader.  He's pretty cool; he just turned 15 a couple of months ago, but hasn't gotten too cool to be seen with you yet.

Darkness
It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

The darkness above you flies open, and you're momentarily blinded by a flood of bright light.  As you try to blink away the spots, a face swims into view -- it takes you a few moments to register the curly white hair, the rosy cheeks and the clear blue eyes, and the fact that said face is talking to you.

"Hullo, Daniel.  My goodness, you gave us a scare.  How are you feeling?"

1. "I'm alive, I think."
2. "What just happened?"
3. "What the hell just happened?"
4. "I just woke up in a coffin!  I thought I was being buried alive!  How do you think I feel?"

>1
"I'm alive, I think."

"That's the spirit!"  The face breaks into a smile, complete with dimples.

"Here, sit up.  I'm Dr Claudia Rose, by the way, and you and your brother are very lucky that your particular condition happens to be a specialty of mine."

1. "Condition?  What condition?"
2. "What... has something happened to Aidan?"

>1
"Condition?  What condition?"

"You're developing some rather unique abilities, Daniel.  As far as I can tell, based on what your friends have told me, you are gaining the ability to sense the emotions of the people around you.  At the moment, your brain is trying to cope with the influx of these new senses and trying to interpret them using the template of the other five; before long, you should start recognizing emotions for what they are, rather than sensing them as flavors or colours or smells."

1. "So ... what, I'm going to be some sort of mind-reader?"
2. "So what DID happen at dinner?"
3. "So I've got to avoid people now or I'll wind up here again?"
4. "That sounds kind of cool, actually...."

>1
"So ... what, I'm going to be some sort of mind-reader?"

Dr Rose chuckles.  "If you want to put it that way.  You won't be reading minds, exactly, but otherwise it's not such a bad analogy."

"Your friends tell me you've been able to track people using the emotional debris they leave in their wake.  That's really quite impressive.  You should also be able to get an idea of how a person feels by examining them, and possibly more if you focus on those emotions.  Eventually, I think you might even be able to amplify or muffle whatever emotion you find, though right now that ability may only manifest in times of extreme stress, as it was with the manifestation of Aidan's abilities."

1. "Aidan's abilities?  What do you mean?"
2. "Can I see Aidan?"
3. "I guess that sort of went out of control at dinner...."

>1
"Aidan's abilities?  What do you mean?"

"Your brother Aidan carried you here after you collapsed at dinner last night."  Dr Rose pauses.  "A distance of about a mile, running at thirty miles an hour, he was here before anyone at the camp could fully explain over the phone what had happened."

1. "Where is he?  I want to see him."
2. "So what DID happen?"

>1
"Where is he?  I want to see him."

"Your conditions are quite delicate, Daniel, and I don't want you to experience a relapse or anything of the sort.  The exertion may be too much, and I don't want you to excite yourself.  So please stay in your room, refrain from exerting yourself, and wait until I'm sure that your condition is stable."

"I have spoken to your parents, by the way, and explained everything to them.  As you know, they're overseas and cannot return at the moment, at least not on such short notice.  In the meantime, they've left me in charge of your health and welfare.  So, Daniel, if anything bothers you at all, I hope you will tell me about it.  I'll do anything I can to make sure you're safe."

Dr Rose pats you on the shoulder and is about to say something more when there's a resounding crash from somewhere else in the hospital.  At the same time, the pager on Dr Rose's belt goes off.  You catch a glimpse of a number, R15, flashing on its face as Dr Rose looks down at it.  She frowns.  "I'm sorry to have to cut our little chat short, Daniel, but it seems I'm urgently needed elsewhere.  Remember, stay where you are, and don't exert yourself."  With that, she hurries out of the room, leaving a cloud of apprehension (or is it anxiety?) in her wake.

As the door closes behind her, Ava and Stacy slip into the room.  "Daniel!" says Ava, "what happened?  Are you going to be okay?"

"Ava, stop worrying and let him answer already."  Stacy's eye wanders over to the cranial crown contraption.  You don't need super emo-detector powers to see that her curiosity is piqued.

Northwest Corner Of Hospital

You can see a door to R15 here.

>n
Looking through the window, you see a room equipped in much the same way your room was, complete with the silvery, high-tech coffin thing.  That's where the resemblance ends.  The lid of the coffin thing has been broken off and lies at the far end of the room, a huge crack down its middle, and smoke billows out from one broken monitor.  Aidan himself is lying near the coffin, unconscious, while a bunch of orderlies stand at a very safe distance away from him.

Fear, shock, whatever, it's thick in the air and feels like you just snorted hot salsa up your nose.

In the middle of all this is Dr Rose.  You can't hear what she's saying but ... oh, well, it looks like she's done lecturing the orderlies and now she's heading for the door.  You pull back before she sees you.  You've got to get back to your room before she notices you're gone, but you're in a corner and there's no way to know which way she'll turn when she comes out, and if you hide in the empty room to the west Dr Rose will almost certainly get to your room before you.

"Go that way," Stacy whispers, shoving you eastwards.  "I'll distract them."  Before you can say anything, Stacy has run off to the south.

"Ava went to look in on him while we were waiting to see you," says Stacy.  "He's somewhere on this floor too, isn't he?"

"They wouldn't let me in to see him, either," Ava says, "and it's not as if anything had happened to him or anything.  He's in room R15."

1. "R15?  That's the number I saw flashing on Dr Rose's pager!"


>1
"R15?  That's the number I saw flashing on Dr Rose's pager!"

"Something must have happened," you say, "I'll bet it has something to do with that crash I heard ... I've got to see what's going on!"

1. "I'll rest after I've checked in on Aidan!"
2. "I feel fine!"
3. "I suppose you're right.  Someone will tell me if it's something to do with Aidan."

Ava tries to stop you, but you push past her to the door.  You don't stop to look back as you slip out onto the corridor.

For a moment, you feel a bit lost as you realize that you have no idea where room R15 might be, but then you sense Stacy and Ava joining you.  "Aidan's room is that way," Ava says quietly, pointing off to the northwest.

Dr Rose waves a hand at what appears to be a steampunk salon hair dryer.  "This is a cranial crown that will flood your brain with an electromagnetic frequency that should dampen the new sensory stimulus going to your brain -- giving it a rest, as it were -- and prevent it from going out of control again."

You should also be able to get an idea of how a person feels by examining them, and possibly more if you focus on those emotions.  Eventually, I think you might even be able to amplify or muffle whatever emotion you find, though right now that ability may only manifest in times of extreme stress, as it was with the manifestation of Aidan's abilities."

1. "Can I see Aidan?"
2. "I guess that sort of went out of control at dinner...."

"I guess that sort of went out of control at dinner...."

Dr Rose nods.  "This sort of thing must be expected as you're first getting used to your new abilities, I suppose.  In the meantime, I've set up this device here to help you out."  She indicates what appears to be a steampunk salon hair dryer.  "This is a cranial crown.  It will flood your brain with an electromagnetic frequency that should dampen the new sensory stimulus going to your brain, giving it a rest and allowing it to recuperate enough so it doesn't go out of control again.  You'll have to undergo this treatment at least once a week, I'd say."

"I have spoken to your parents, by the way, and explained everything to them.  As you know, they're overseas and cannot return at the moment, at least not on such short notice.  In the meantime, they've left me in charge of your health and welfare.  So, Daniel, if anything bothers you at all, I hope you will tell me about it.  I'll do anything I can to make sure you're safe."

Dr Rose pats you on the shoulder and is about to say something more when there's a resounding crash from somewhere else in the hospital.  At the same time, the pager on Dr Rose's belt goes off.  You catch a glimpse of a number, R15, flashing on its face as Dr Rose looks down at it.  She frowns.  "I'm sorry to have to cut our little chat short, Daniel, but it seems I'm urgently needed elsewhere.  Remember, stay where you are, and don't exert yourself."  With that, she hurries out of the room, leaving a cloud of apprehension (or is it anxiety?) in her wake.

As the door closes behind her, Ava and Stacy slip into the room.  "Daniel!" says Ava, "what happened?  Are you going to be okay?"

"Ava, stop worrying and let him answer already."  Stacy's eye wanders over to the cranial crown contraption.  You don't need super emo-detector powers to see that her curiosity is piqued.

>tell ava about powers
"I don't know what to say, Daniel."  Ava shifts uncomfortably.  "It's like something out of a comic book."

[You achieved a goal! (find out what's happened to you)]

>tell stacy about powerse
There is no reply.

>tell stacy about powers
"So you've got these super emo-powers now?  I think I'm jealous."  She isn't really, you know, but you somehow know that she finds the idea absolutely fascinating.

>save
Ok.

(Aidan)
"Ava went to look in on him while we were waiting to see you," says Stacy.  "He's somewhere on this floor too, isn't he?"

"They wouldn't let me in to see him, either," Ava says, "and it's not as if anything had happened to him or anything.  He's in room R15."

1. "R15?  That's the number I saw flashing on Dr Rose's pager!"


>1
"R15?  That's the number I saw flashing on Dr Rose's pager!"

"Something must have happened," you say, "I'll bet it has something to do with that crash I heard ... I've got to see what's going on!"

"No, wait," Ava says, "you're supposed to be resting!"

1. "I'll rest after I've checked in on Aidan!"
2. "I feel fine!"
3. "I suppose you're right.  Someone will tell me if it's something to do with Aidan."

>2
"I feel fine!"

"Well you don't know that you actually are fine!"  Ava moves to block your way.

"I'd like to know what that noise was, too," Stacy says, "and, come on, aren't you the least bit concerned?  It might have something to do with Aidan!"

Ava looks anxious and uncertain, then finally backs down.  "Okay, fine, but we better not get caught."

Stacy opens the door, and you all slip out into the corridor.  Ava points off to the northwest.  "Aidan's room is that way."

South T-Intersection
You are in a featureless hospital corridor stretching from east to west.  Another corridor goes off to the north.  The door to your hospital room is to the south.

[That command asks to do something outside of play, so it can only make sense from you to me. The wandering orderly cannot be asked to do this.]

This is the heart of this particular wing of the hospital, with corridors running off in all four cardinal directions.

Northwest Corner Of Hospital
The corridor makes a bend here, going east and south.  There are hospital rooms to the west and north, although the sounds coming from the north suggest that that particular hospital room is not quite as empty as all the others have been.

Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. 

You can also see a door to R15 here.

"Here we are," whispers Ava, pointing to a door to the north.  "That's room R15.  Aidan's in there."

>n
Looking through the window, you see a room equipped in much the same way your room was, complete with the silvery, high-tech coffin thing.  That's where the resemblance ends.  The lid of the coffin thing has been broken off and lies at the far end of the room, a huge crack down its middle, and smoke billows out from one broken monitor.  Aidan himself is lying near the coffin, unconscious, while a bunch of orderlies stand at a very safe distance away from him.

Fear, shock, whatever, it's thick in the air and feels like you just snorted hot salsa up your nose.

In the middle of all this is Dr Rose.  You can't hear what she's saying but ... oh, well, it looks like she's done lecturing the orderlies and now she's heading for the door.  You pull back before she sees you.  You've got to get back to your room before she notices you're gone, but you're in a corner and there's no way to know which way she'll turn when she comes out, and if you hide in the empty room to the west Dr Rose will almost certainly get to your room before you.

"Go that way," Stacy whispers, shoving you eastwards.  "I'll distract them."  Before you can say anything, Stacy has run off to the south.

Your Hospital Room
You are in a hospital room, equipped with a single bizarre-looking coffin-case thing attached to a bewildering wall of medical equipment.  The walls are painted a sterile white.  Huge windows look out to the south, while a pale green door, equipped with a small viewing window, is to the north.

Ava trails along behind you. 

And not a moment too soon.  When Dr Rose comes bustling in, you are back in the coffin thing and Ava is sitting beside you, looking as if you'd just spent the past half hour talking about the weather.  Dr Rose frowns a bit when she checks the readouts on the various monitors, but no-one can look as innocent as Ava when she has to, and in the end Dr Rose decides that nothing suspicious has been going on after all.

Aidan, she says, is still undergoing observation of some kind, but you're free to go back to camp.  Brad picks you up after lunch (it turns out that the hospital food tastes just as nasty as the camp food) and you're back in time for your afternoon classes.  It's dinner time before Aidan is back at camp; and whatever it was that happened to him in the hospital, he either doesn't remember, or doesn't want to tell you.


Please press SPACE to continue.

Things settle down, more or less, over the next day or so.  People are trying very hard to not give you funny looks when they see you, which pretty much comes to the same thing, really.  Aidan's probably going through the same sort of thing too.  He's certainly rather a bit more moody than he used to be.

LEAP, Day 6 (Friday) - Class Period 2

Robotics class, the wave of the future, because everyone knows that some day we're going to have giant killer robots laying waste to downtown Tokyo or something like that, and it would be a good thing to know how to deal with them.  No-one's really capable of making a giant killer robot: right now, you're all just doing a basic project to program a robot to do a certain simple task.  Except Stacy, who seems to be dead set on making a midget killer robot she calls the "Stacy Alexander Robot Guy", or SARG for short.

Robotics Class
You sit at a table in a perfectly ordinary classroom, surrounded by electronic parts.  Antonia Long, your Robotics instructor, has been cornered elsewhere by students with issues, leaving you to your own electronic, robotic devices.  Stacy sits beside you with her own robot project, SARG, while Aidan is at another table with the older students.

Stacy is sitting beside you, completely absorbed in her project.

On your workbench are some programming logic blocks, all different colors: forest green, baby blue, magenta, mint green, golden, saffron, scarlet, hot pink, royal purple and copper-colored, your robot, a metal bowl (empty) and a wicker basket (in which are seven marbles).

>[okay, there we go]
