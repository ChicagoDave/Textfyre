Robotics Class
You sit at a table in a perfectly ordinary classroom, surrounded by electronic parts.  Antonia Long, your Robotics instructor, has been cornered elsewhere by students with issues, leaving you to your own electronic, robotic devices.  Stacy sits beside you with her own robot project, SARG, while Aidan is at another table with the older students.

Stacy is sitting beside you, completely absorbed in her project.

On your workbench are hot pink logic block, your robot, a metal bowl (empty) and a wicker basket (in which are seven marbles).

>get hot

>put hot in slot 10

Going down the list of slots, your program reads as follows:

In slot 1, mint green logic block:

        if (holding_marble) {
In slot 2, saffron logic block:
            turn_to_destination_basket;

            if (last_used == left) {
                pick_up_with_right;
In slot 3, forest green logic block:

            } else {
In slot 4, royal purple logic block:

[mint green] The robot does an exaggerated sigh, and looks down at the metal bowl.  [saffron] The robot turns to face the metal bowl.  It tilts its head to the left.  And to the right. It then grabs thin air, as there aren't any marbles in the metal bowl.  [forest green] The robot deliberately nods to itself, as if to say, "ok."  It then tilts its head to the left.  [royal purple] The robot's left hand grabs thin air, as there aren't any marbles in the metal bowl.  [copper-colored] The robot nods to itself, as if it just told itself something it needs to remember.  [baby blue] The robot deliberately nods, as if to reaffirm something in its mind.  It then turns toward the metal bowl.  [scarlet] The robot tilts its head to the left.  [magenta] The robot tilts its head back, as if trying to remember something.  It opens its hand, to no effect.  [golden] The robot turns to face the wicker basket.  [hot pink] The robot seems to sigh, as if its doing something its getting bored of.  

Daniel's robot does all the marbles, then messes with SARG (Stacy's robot), whose "jet boots" fly it around uncontrollably.  Aidan smashes it angrily.  Instructor Antonia tsks Aidan for method and Stacy for lacking "safety features". Aidan apologizes to Antonia, shoots a dark look at Stacy, and leaves.  Stacy is upset, and Daniel wonders what's wrong with his brother.

Please press SPACE to continue.

Things are a little tense Friday evening, and through most of Saturday.  Stacy is angry with Aidan for what he did to SARG, Aidan is being all sulky and broody and unsociable, and Ava seems to have had an argument with Stacy over who was right or wrong in the Great Robotics Class Incident.  You, meanwhile, have simply been watching the ebb and flow of everybody's emotional states.

You're getting better at this.  Some things don't even register as smells or sounds or colours any more, but as recognizable emotions.  So of course, since you're the one who can see the best time to approach people, you're the one to go gather everyone together for Sunday's event.

LEAP, Day 8 (Sunday) - Mid-afternoon

Everyone looks forward to Sim Sunday!  That's when people get to go into the Simulation Room and play through the scenario that some of the counselors have spent the whole year putting together.  It is quite literally THE great virtual reality event of the entire camp.

The Simulation Room functions as a sort of giant virtual reality suit, recreating a whole other world that you and a few other campers can enter and interact with.  There's always a scenario of some sort involved: a few campers are let in to run through it, some playing principal speaking parts while others play less important roles or even just stand around as non-speaking extras.  Everybody wants to get in on this, of course, so as soon as one group has played through the scenario, they're moved out while another group starts over again.

This year, they're doing Robin Hood And The Monk.  You went through this as a non-speaking extra (Random Church-Goer #5) this morning, but this time around you've snagged a major speaking role: you're Little John.  Or rather, thou art Little John.  'Tis of great importance that thou immerseth thyself in thy part, is't not?

Under The Greenwood Tree
Thou art in the company of thy master's men, the merry men of Sherwood Forest.  "Tis a sunny morning in May, and the merry birds doth sing in the trees above.

Much, the Miller's Son, as played by thy friend Stacy, loiters.

Robin Hood, thy brother-in-arms, standeth before thee.

"I dunno, John, it's just that every Sunday we're here in the woods, it's like there's no difference from day to day, you know?  And today is White Sunday, too.  I really should be in church.  It's been two weeks since I've been to Mass."

"Then let us go, for if that is what ailest thee, then we shouldst find both salve and salvation at Nottingham church."

Robin fixeth upon thee a look of no small wonderment.  "You've been double-dipping into the Shakespeare, haven't you?  Well, I think it's a good idea, anyway.  To Nottingham!"

"Wait," quoth Much, the miller's son, "aren't you wanted in Nottingham for highway robbery?  You should take some men with you.  Twelve guys, maybe, to watch your back."

Er, according to the poem, this is the part where thou art supposed to tell Robin to carry his own bow, as thou shalt be carrying thine own, but Robin seemeth not to heed the script, and fixeth Much with a stern and a terrible eye.  "Are you trying to tell me I can't take care of myself?"

"Do whatever you want," quoth Much, who sulketh and looketh away all too quickly.  Methinks the lad be not comfortable arguing with Robin.

"Fine." Robin taketh up his bow, and bids thee take thine own.  "Let's get moving."

Old Archery Range
Though all of Sherwood be thy range, this sunny glen doth lend itself best to thy sport.  A stump by thy feet doth provide adequate place for thy wager, and targets lean upon the trees at the opposite side of the glen.

Robin Hood, thy brother-in-arms, standeth before thee.

"Ah, the old archery range.  Good times, eh?  I think we've got some time before Mass, so how about a bit of archery practice?  I'll give you 3 to 1 odds: three pennies to you for every target you hit, if you'll give me one for every target I hit."

"Thou shalt be the poorer man for this, I'll wager!"
