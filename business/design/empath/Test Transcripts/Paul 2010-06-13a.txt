Old Archery Range
Though all of Sherwood be thy range, this sunny glen doth lend itself best to thy sport.  A stump by thy feet doth provide adequate place for thy wager, and targets lean upon the trees at the opposite side of the glen.

Robin Hood, thy brother-in-arms, standeth before thee.

>ask aidan about stacy
Much may be made of muchness, but thy comrade appeareth not in the humor to humor thy question.

That's not a verb I recognize.

>focus on aidan
Thy brother is in a temper, and thou shouldst tread carefully about him.

>[yeah, there's definitely more there to show.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

'Tis as flat as a table, and hath oft served as a place upon which to place thy wagers when thou and thy friends take up thy bows against thy fearsome foes, the targets.

>put dollars on stump
You put the dollars on the stump.

>[heh. Shouldn't be possible, but is making me smile at the moment.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>shoot tree
You can't see any such thing.

>shoot target
Thy arrow is unfortunately wide of the target.  Robin doth smirk as he fitteth an arrow upon his own bowstring.

Robin doth raise up his bow and let fly his shot, straight and true, to the heart of the target.  Well shot, indeed.

>[an impressive feat for somebody with no bow.]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>shoot target
Well shot!  Thou art another three pennies ahead of thy companion!

Robin doth shoot his arrow, which misseth the target by a hair.  With a scowl, he bids thee take thy turn.

>["another" three pennies? I've only shot one other time, and I missed that one.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[Also, the shots should begin with wagers placed on the stump. It's fine if the game fills in this action from the command SHOOT TARGET, but it needs to say that's what it's doing. Otherwise all this talk of who's ahead will confuse the heck out of people.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[Of course, if the goals were working, that would help too.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>shoot target
Thy arrow seemeth to shimmer in its flight, and striketh the target but close to the edge.  A lucky shot indeed!

Robin shooteth, but scoreth not.

Thou art a full two shillings, or four-and-twenty pennies, ahead of thy companion.  Verily, thou hast won the contest.  With ill humor, Robin doth gather up the arrows and prepareth to continue upon his way to Nottingham.

>[Not sure how I got that far ahead that quickly.]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>[Anyway, right here is where the scrolls would chime and new goals would appear. I envision Aidan scooping up all the money from the stump, which is what would start the argument.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>ask robin about money
"Robin, I have won of thee fairly two shillings, and would have thee pay me what thou owest."

"Don't be stupid.  I don't owe you any such thing.  And for goodness' sake, drop the fake Shakespeare already.  It's not even the right time period for Robin Hood."

1. "Verily thou owest me that much, and I demand it of thee!"
2. "You do so owe me two shillings!  Cough it up!"
3. "C'mon, it's in character, anyway.  Pay unto me the two shillings, as thou didst promise!"

>3
"C'mon, it's in character, anyway.  Pay unto me the two shillings, as thou didst promise!"

"And you are a miserable liar!  Shut up and get moving or we'll be late for church!"

1. "Nay, 'tis thou who art the liar!  Thou dost so owe me two shillings!"
2. "Nay, I shall not, for thou art a faithless master and I shall have none of thee!  If thou goest, thou goest alone!"
3. "Very well, if thou insists upon it.  Let us go on."

>2
"Nay, I shall not, for thou art a faithless master and I shall have none of thee!  If thou goest, thou goest alone!"

Thou turnst upon thy heel to stride off, but Aidan doth grab thee by the shoulder and spins thee around to face him.  "Don't you DARE turn your back on me!" he roars.

Aidan ('tis useless now to call him "Robin", for he hath dropped all pretense of playing the part) doth take a menacing step towards you, forcing you to backpedal in alarm.  You can sense the rush of emotion in and around him, like a hurricane, building in intensity.  He raises a fist to make a point, but you have no idea what he's saying because the force of his emotion has, at that point, suddenly exploded in your face, knocking you flat out on your back.

The next thing you know, you are sitting up outside the simulation room.  Brad, your counselor, is kneeling beside you with a concerned look on his face.  "Whew, almost thought we'd have to ship you over to the hospital again.  You okay?  I'm afraid we can't put you back into the sim as Little John.  We didn't know how long you'd be out, so we let someone else take your place."

Behind him, you can see Aidan apologizing madly to the other counselors.  Clearly he's been pulled out of the sim too, and been replaced.  But there's something wrong with the picture ... it isn't until later that you realise that this time, unlike the incident with Stacy's robot, he really doesn't care whether or not he did anything wrong....

Everything is Absolutely Fine.

At least, that's what you keep telling everybody who asks, especially the ones who stink of Morbid Curiosity.  You're guessing that your little fainting spell, at the Sim Sunday event, was something similar to what happened at dinner with Lucian last week, but at least this time round you didn't wind up in the hospital.  It looks really bad for Aidan, though: some of the people who used to hang out with him are giving him the cold shoulder now, and Stacy is definitely actively avoiding him.

You have no idea what sort of emotion could have knocked you out like that.  And you're kind of leery of checking out Aidan's emotional status these days....

LEAP, Day 9 (Monday) - Class Period 1

Satirical drama.  The best way to take your mind off your troubles is to laugh at them, and some of the other people doing this class are pretty good.  You've spent half the class period listening to other people reading their stuff, but now it's time to work on your own stuff.  You're looking forward to putting this on stage this Friday, and that's enough to make you forget everything else.

Auditorium
The chairs of the auditorium have been folded up and moved aside, to give everyone plenty of room to spread out in the middle and even on the stage.  A rather harsh, bright light illuminates the central portion of the room and leaves the corners in shadows; the overall effect is to produce that still, dead, rather muffled feel that most theaters seem to have when they're not in use.  The backstage areas are to the north, and the main exit is to the west.

>[The description mentions that there's space for everybody, but I think there should be a bit of atmospheric text here and there describing the class in session. At the moment it still kind of feels like Daniel's alone in an empty auditorium]

.

The alarm bells go off.  Judging by the reactions of the counselors and instructors, this is not a drill.  You are about to follow everyone out (in a not-so-orderly fashion) when you see Ava fighting her way past the surging crowd.  She sees you and immediately pulls you aside.

"Daniel! Thank goodness I found you.  You know what the alarm is all about?  It's about Aidan!  He's gone crazy ... we were in the middle of our film class when Lucian -- you remember him -- accidentally jostled the camera and ruined Aidan's shot, and then Aidan went berserk!  I swear, he tried to kill Lucian!"

1. "Don't tell me Lucian's dead?"
2. "Why are you telling me this?"
3. "What do you mean, Aidan went berserk?"
4. "You're joking, right?"

>1
"Don't tell me Lucian's dead?"

"No no, he got away.  Aidan tried to hit him and got his fist stuck in a wall, and Lucian ran off ... now Aidan's running around the school trying to find Lucian, and if we don't find him first Aidan is really going to kill him!  I mean it!"  You've never seen Ava look this distraught. "Lucian's bound to be terrified.  Can't you find him the same way you found him the last time?"

You glance around.  Everyone's already left, and, standing as you were in the shadows of the auditorium, you and Ava were missed in the general exodus.  "All right," you say, "we'd better find Lucian and get him out of here."

"As long as Lucian doesn't make you go crazy like he did the last time." 


>focus
You sense a confusion of trails, all of them scented with fear.  More than one of them seem strong enough to be Lucian's, assuming he's as terrified as you think he is, though none are precisely alike.

>n

Backstage
Backstage is cramped, cluttered and chaotic, and it's not even in use yet.  It also smells of old costumes, which is hardly surprising, given the racks of costumes mouldering in one airless cubbyhole.  The stage and the auditorium are to the south, and a door out into the hallway is to the west.

Ava trails along behind you. 

>x costumes
A brief rummage through the costumes reveals nothing but dust, more costumes, an air vent, and an overwhelming urge to sneeze.

>x vent
The air vent is almost hidden behind the racks of costumes.

>look in vent
The air vent is empty.

>open vent
You're not strong enough to tear this thing from the wall with your bare hands.

>enter vent
The vent is covered over with a metal grill, to prevent silly people like you from getting lost in an HVAC maze of twisty little ducts, all alike.  You couldn't turn around in there, anyway, and the idea of crawling backwards through such a tight squeeze, in darkness, makes you want to hurl.

Eastern Hallway
A utilitarian, academic hallway, stretching north and south.  Two empty classrooms are on the west side.  On the east side, the door to the backstage areas of the auditorium is to the southeast, while half of the film studio lies northeast.

Northeast Corner Of Claremont
The hallway makes an elbow here, heading off to the south and the west.  To the east is the film studio.  You can tell because the door has been torn off its hinges, giving you a perfectly unimpeded view of the studio within.  Another set of doors, to the north, leads out of the building, but those are intact.

Ava trails along behind you.

Which do you mean, the film studio north or the film studio south?

You've never been to the film studio north so you can't recall.

Film Studio, North
The film studio has been deserted, and in a hurry, too.  Notebooks and papers and pens have been dropped or left behind, and chairs have been overturned.  It is quiet, the only sounds being the hum of warm air being pushed into the room through the vent high up in the wall.  The studio continues off to the south, and the exit to the hallway is to the west.

Ava trails along behind you. 

>x vent
This particular vent doesn't have a grill, and the rows of shelving beneath it make it fairly accessible.  The wall around it looks as if it's been attacked with a sledgehammer.  Unfortunately for whoever attacked it, the dents in the metal duct have only served to make the opening more difficult to climb through.

The duct beyond might be wide enough to crawl through, though not to turn around, but the vent itself is too small for you to fit through now.  Maybe you shouldn't have had that growth spurt after all.

Film Studio, South
This end of the film studio looks like the aftermath of a particularly exuberant action flick.  Tables, chairs and assorted props have been hurled about, some of it even broken in the process, and a fist-sized hole has been punched into one wall.  It's a little less untidy to the north, and the door to the hallway is to the west.

Claremont Library
The Education And Fine Arts Library, as befits the University of Colorado at Valmont, is a labyrinth stacked high with books and simply lousy with hidden corners and dead ends.  Thankfully, most of it is also sealed away beyond a security barrier, and as far as you can tell, no-one is likely to have slipped through to the stacks beyond.  The only part of the library you can really access from here is the circulation desk, which has been positioned directly under an air vent to allow the librarians the full benefit of the heating system during the cold winter semester.  And also to blow papers off the desk, but none of the librarians have complained about that one little detail, oddly enough.

Southeast Corner Of Claremont
You're at a T-junction, of sorts.  Hallways stretch off to the north and west; another hallway stretches off to the south, ramping up slightly as it passes from this building to the next.  You catch sight of two of the counselors pacing about at the end of the southern hallway; fortunately, they haven't seen you ... yet.  The door to the auditorium where you were supposed to spend this morning working on your satirical drama class is to the east.

Southwest Corner Of Claremont
Not actually a corner, but enough of one for your purposes: the counselors standing guard to the south make you rather hesitant to wander off in that direction.  Fortunately, they're more concerned with keeping the other students from coming over onto this side, and aren't looking behind them for people who've already done so.  That leaves the north and the east open to travel.

Northwest Corner Of Claremont
The hallway goes east and south from here.  To the north is an exit from the building.  You notice a door, previously locked, has been smashed open; beyond it, stairs lead down into the basement.  You can easily sense that Aidan has been here: you can trace two trails, one going down the stairs and another running off to the south.

HVAC Room
This is essentially a concrete basement full of pipes and maintenance equipment.  The master HVAC unit takes up half the space, and all the vents and chutes and pipes coming into or out of it takes up almost all the rest.

Ava trails along behind you. 

>x unit
Essentially a furnace, generating hot air which is then pumped up to all the rooms of the building above.  The central thermostat, here, regulates the general temperature.  Judging by the roaring sound, it's working overtime to generate as much heat as it possibly can.

>x thermostat
The central thermostat consists of a simple dial which can be turned, and a meter above showing the temperature of the building.  Someone has set the the thermostat to the maximum!  The meter is slowly but surely climbing towards the danger zone.

>x meter
You can't see such a thing.

You quickly turn the thermostat down to a more normal setting.  Immediately, the HVAC unit falls silent.  It'll be a while before the temperature drops back to normal, but at least it's not rising.

Claremont Library
The Education And Fine Arts Library, as befits the University of Colorado at Valmont, is a labyrinth stacked high with books and simply lousy with hidden corners and dead ends.  Thankfully, most of it is also sealed away beyond a security barrier, and as far as you can tell, no-one is likely to have slipped through to the stacks beyond.  The only part of the library you can really access from here is the circulation desk, which has been positioned directly under an air vent to allow the librarians the full benefit of the heating system during the cold winter semester.  And also to blow papers off the desk, but none of the librarians have complained about that one little detail, oddly enough.

Auditorium
The chairs of the auditorium have been folded up and moved aside, to give everyone plenty of room to spread out in the middle and even on the stage.  A rather harsh, bright light illuminates the central portion of the room and leaves the corners in shadows; the overall effect is to produce that still, dead, rather muffled feel that most theaters seem to have when they're not in use.  The backstage areas are to the north, and the main exit is to the west.
