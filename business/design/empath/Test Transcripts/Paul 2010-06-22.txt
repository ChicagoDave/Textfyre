Looks like you're back in school again.  There's the old chalkboard, and all the familiar desks and chairs, all looking a little smaller than you remember.  By contrast, the teacher's desk looms menacingly at one shadowy end of the room.  There is an exit to the south.

Crossroads
You are standing at a crossroads.  A signpost indicates exits to the north, south, east, and west; the lamp perched on the top of the signpost does not illuminate enough of the area that you can actually see these exits, so having these indicators is a great help.  A spiral staircase leads back upwards.  You can faintly hear someone playing the blues on an alto sax.

You bravely march off into the shadows in that direction.  For a while, you can see nothing around you except for the ground at your feet and the shadows beyond the light ... and then you finally arrive at...

Xroads
You are standing at an Xroads, which differ from a mere crossroads in that the roads go off diagonally, that is, to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest.  Another narrow path goes back west to the crossroads.

>ne

Curtain Room
You are in a perfectly cubical room, with wall-to-wall carpeting and wood-paneled walls.  An archway at the southwest corner leads back towards the Xroads.  The entire east wall is taken up by a red curtain that wafts and rustles in the nonexistent breeze.

Art Gallery
This was clearly an art gallery once, but the walls are bare: you can see squares and rectangles of unfaded wallpaper where paintings used to hang.  An archway in the northwest corner would take you back to the Xroads.

Only one painting still remains on the wall, and it's not a painting at all: it's a calligraphy scroll of some kind.

Tree
You are standing in the middle of a forest, which is interesting because you cannot for the life of you remember the point at which the underground passageway, which you recall as being to the southeast, suddenly turned into a forest path.  Just as interesting is the gigantic tree here, towering high above all the other trees and penetrating the cloud cover far above.  

>x tree


>[???]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>climb tree
I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

They're fluffy and white and clearly indicate that you are outside rather than underground.  Funny, you don't remember having descended quite so far as to have gotten beneath the clouds.

Fork
The shadowy passage from the east forks here, to the northwest and southwest.  A dim glow can be discerned at the end of the northwest fork; to the southwest, you can see only darkness.

>sw

Maintenance Room
This looks suspiciously like the bridge of your Dad's ship, at least what you remember of it from your visit to the naval base a couple of years ago.  Banks of controls line the walls, most of them blinking and beyond complicated.  One solitary terminal, separate from the others, seems simple enough, however.  Through a door to the northeast, which you do not remember opening to get in here, is the passage back to the fork.

>x terminal
This terminal consists of a monitor screen, a red button, and a blue button.  The screen shows six boxes, labeled A to F: A and B in the top row, and the remaining four in the bottom row.  Horizontal lines connect boxes A to B,  and D to E.  A vertical line joins boxes A and D.  Finally, a diagonal line joins boxes B and E.

>x red button
The red button is labeled with the greek letter omega.  It is currently not pressed.

>push red button
The red button sinks into the panel and locks into place with a soft click.  Off in the distance, you hear the grinding of heavy machinery.

The rocks are round, flat, very smooth, and very regular.  They look as if each would fit quite comfortably in your palm.  Half-buried beneath the pile of rocks is a sign which says "Lair Sweet Lair".

Living Room
You are standing in your living room.  At least, it looks just like your living room back home, except for the trap door in the floor where the stairs used to be.  The kitchen is off to the east, just as you remember it.  And Dad's trophy case, there in the corner, seems a little larger and more imposing than you remember, come to think of it.

>e

Kitchen
This looks almost exactly like your kitchen back home, except that the door to the basement is missing.  Also, there's a blank wall where the entrance to the dining room used to be.  The kitchen table is pushed up under a window, just as it has always been, but the chairs are missing.

>e

Mountain View
The ground just drops away a short distance away from the house, descending straight down into the clouds miles below.  The only solid object you can see beyond the clouds is a mountain far off into the distance.  The only way back into the house is through the kitchen window.

>throw rock at birds
You can't see any such thing.

>x mountain
The mountain rises straight up from the clouds, its ice-covered peak glinting in the sunlight.  In the ice, you can see Aidan's face, scowling murderously back at you.

>[oh huh. I guess all the birds left. It's great playing from a design I wrote so long ago. Of course, that also means I don't know if anything's missing (I seem to recall scuba equipment in the maintenance room, but maybe that was an earlier draft...)]

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Your throw, while unnaturally strong and accurate, is swallowed up by the dark mass.

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

It shifts slightly, enough so you can tell that it's not a single, solid entity.

You can't see such a thing.

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Thief's Den
You have managed to find your way into the thief's den, a seedy little place higher than it is wide and lined with shelves displaying the thief's ill-gotten gains.  The only piece of furniture appears to be a dirty mattress on the floor.  A spiral stair winds back up to the twisty passages of the maze.

Surprised, the thief twists to his feet, pulling a knife.

You can also see some night vision goggles here.

>x thief
The thief bounds around to one side and lashes out at you.  You deflect his blow just in time.

>kill thief
Oh, hey, you know kung fu.  Since when did you know kung fu?  Clearly Aidan must think you ought to know kung fu, because here you do.  You show the thief.

WHAM!

The thief rolls to one side as he lands, and is quickly on his feet again.  He shakes his head, as if to clear it, and aims a deadly jab at your throat.  You manage to dodge the worst of it, but it still clips you quite painfully on the shoulder.

>g
THUD.

The thief scrambles to his feet again, and adopts a defensive position.

>g
CRACK!

The thief tries to get up, but this time your awesome in-this-world-only kung fu skills prove too much for him, and he collapses, unconscious.

[You achieved a goal! (Defeat the Thief)]

>x thief
Black smoke begins to emit from the fallen thief, only slightly at first, then billowing out in greater and greater amounts.  Again you hear the distant sound of cawing birds, but this time, the sound draws closer, as if they come for you.  As the cold smoke fills the room, it begins to circle and swirl, until resolving itself into a mass of inky-black birds, cawing, echoing, shrieking within the small space.  You duck down, cover your head and your ears, await some sort of onslaught, but, it does not come.  The black flock thins on its own, not so much flying down the only exit, as disappearing through the rock itself.

>[wow, great desc]

This looks suspiciously like the bridge of your Dad's ship, at least what you remember of it from your visit to the naval base a couple of years ago.  Banks of controls line the walls, most of them blinking and beyond complicated.  One solitary terminal, separate from the others, seems simple enough, however.  Through a door to the northeast, which you do not remember opening to get in here, is the passage back to the fork.

>w
There is an exit northeast (to the fork) from here.

Fork
The shadowy passage from the east forks here, to the northwest and southwest.  A dim glow can be discerned at the end of the northwest fork; to the southwest, you can see only darkness.

Land Of The Dead
You are on a vast, perfectly flat plain of ice.  A platform of some sort has been built out of dry twigs in the middle of the plain; Aidan is lying on it, his arms crossed sedately over his chest.  The spirits of the dead crowd all around, chanting and wailing and gibbering, and preventing you from approaching the platform.

>x spirits
There are shades of every sort of person from every sort of culture and time period, from Viking berserkers to Mandarin courtiers to Victorian fops.  None of them look particularly pleasant, presumably because any remotely nice members of the dearly departed have gone to heaven; which rather implies that this is The Other Place.

Or have you?  The light at the end of the tunnel soon revolves into the ceiling light of the hospital room, and you see Dr Rose looking down at you, her face full of concern.  "Oh dear," she says, "I suppose something went a little wrong in there?  Well, whenever you're ready, I hope you'll give it another try."

Your Hospital Room
The room is, if anything, even more full of medical equipment than the last time you were here.  Aidan has been strapped into that coffin-thing that you woke up in back then, and trussed up so securely that it's a wonder they found anywhere to stick the wires monitoring his condition.  The door is back to the north.

A pair of comfortable chairs have been wheeled in, along with a small table.  Dr Rose sits in one chair, watching you with concern.

Crossroads
You are standing at a crossroads.  A signpost indicates exits to the north, east, and west; the lamp perched on the top of the signpost does not illuminate enough of the area that you can actually see these exits, so having these indicators is a great help.  A spiral staircase leads back upwards.  You can faintly hear someone playing the blues on an alto sax.

Maintenance Room
This looks suspiciously like the bridge of your Dad's ship, at least what you remember of it from your visit to the naval base a couple of years ago.  Banks of controls line the walls, most of them blinking and beyond complicated.  One solitary terminal, separate from the others, seems simple enough, however.  Through a door to the northeast, which you do not remember opening to get in here, is the passage back to the fork.

>x terminal
This terminal consists of a monitor screen, a red button, and a blue button.  The screen shows six boxes, labeled A to F: A and B in the top row, and the remaining four in the bottom row.  Horizontal lines connect boxes A to B, C to D,  and D to E.  Finally, a diagonal line joins boxes B and E.

>x red
The red button is labeled with the greek letter omega.  It is currently pressed.

>x blue
The blue button is labeled with the greek letter alpha.  It is currently not pressed.

>press blue
The red button pops up as you push on the blue button, which sinks into the panel and locks into place with a soft click.  Off in the distance, you hear the grinding of heavy machinery.

Lake Shore
You stand on the shores of what should more properly be called a sea: it is enormous, its far shores lost beyond the reach of any light.  The ceiling of the cavern is lost in the darkness as well; it is so high up that it is entirely possible that there is in fact no ceiling, and that the darkness above is a starless, moonless sky.  Faint music wafts down from above, and the only visible exit is to the west.

Curtain Room
You are in a perfectly cubical room, with wall-to-wall carpeting and wood-paneled walls.  An archway at the southwest corner leads back towards the Xroads.  The entire east wall is taken up by a red curtain that wafts and rustles in the nonexistent breeze.

>cut curtain
The sword sings as it slices through the air and the curtain, cutting through it as if it were nothing but light and shadows.  The fabric seems to dissolve into tendrils of mist as it falls apart, finally leaving the way east open.

>[wow, it's so placeholdery I have no idea what's happening]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>attack thief
Out of nowhere, someone leaps in between you and the thief!  It's Aidan, and more to the point, it's the Aidan that you remember, the one who helps you handle bullies and carries you to the hospital when you freak out in the dining hall!  He barely has time to give you a "hi Daniel" before he and the thief are locked in mortal combat with each other....

The thief is too busy fighting Aidan to attempt to attack you.

>x thief
[placeholder text: "thief"]

 

The thief lashes out at Aidan with his knife and a bucket-load of inhuman speed.  Aidan somehow manages to deflect the attack, but only just.

>kill thief with sword
You can't see any such thing.

>[???]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>[Which, the sword or the thief?]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>kill thief
You karate punch the thief.

The thief lunges at Aidan, who dives for the ground and kicks out at the thief.  The kick manages to catch the thief in the shoulder, sending him spinning off to one side.  Unfortunately, this does not seem to slow the thief down in the slightest.

>g
You judo chop the thief.

Aidan engages the thief in a blur of flying fists and feet, and for a moment the two of them are moving so quickly you're not sure where one of them ends and the other begins.  And when they finally disengage, you can't tell if either of them has managed to land a blow on the other.

>[These descriptions don't seem to be registering my help at all.]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x sword
[placeholder text: "An elvish sword of great antiquity."]



Aidan catches your eye.  "We're too evenly matched," he says, in between deflecting the thief's knife and trying to land a punch, "I could really use an edge here...."

>give sword to aidan
You put the sword on the ground and slide it over to Aidan, who kicks it up into his hands and swings it up to block the Thief's knife.  He's much faster than you are, given the super-speed and super-strength, and you can hear the sword whistling through the air as it whirls, a blue blur around the Thief.  In less than a minute, the Thief's knife goes flying off into the darkness, and the Thief himself is cut down.

There's no blood.

Aidan stands over the Thief, leaning on the sword and panting.  He flashes you a familiar smile.  "Thanks, Daniel.  He almost had me there.  If you hadn't passed me the sword...."  He shakes his head.  "Now, let's see who this fellow is behind his mask."  Leaning down, he pulls off the Thief's mask, revealing the face of ... Dr Claudia Rose.

The scene wavers and dissolves all around you.  Aidan is saying something, but you can't hear him.  And in a moment, you are back in the hospital room, looking at the real Dr Rose, who is smiling quite happily.  "You did it, Daniel!  I knew you could do it!  Look, your brother's looking more peaceful already."

It's true.  Aidan's still unconscious, but he looks a great deal more relaxed, with the same expression of peace that you saw when you put the ring on him back there in the Land of the Dead.  Whatever was going wrong in his head, it's over now.

"For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's...."

You wake up to face the last day of LEAP.  Oh, a big parade, like the one in your dream, would have been nice.  But it looks as if you've been totally out of it since saving Aidan from himself; in fact, Dr Rose's congratulations really were pretty much the last thing you remember before waking up just now, three hours before breakfast, with Dr Rose hovering nearby.  She doesn't appear to have slept all night.

After two hours of various tests and stuff, you and Aidan are both shipped back to camp, and then it's off to breakfast while ignoring all the whispers and the odd looks.  You find a seat in a far corner of the dining hall, while Aidan falls in with some friends who don't think he's going to rip their heads off if they look at him funny.  Almost immediately, Ava and Stacy sit down on either side of you, and Lucian sits himself across the table from you.  At least some people don't think you're an all-out freak....

LEAP, Day 13 (Friday) - Breakfast

You are sitting with Ava and Stacy and Lucian; otherwise, there's no-one else at the table.  Somewhere else in the dining hall, Aidan is sitting with a small handful of friends who still think he's okay, murderous psycho rages or not.  A lot of the people have finished breakfast and moved on, but you've been busy telling your friends about your adventures through Aidan's mindscape.

Dining Hall
You are sitting between Ava and Stacy.  Lucian is sitting across from you, half-hidden behind a stack of pancakes.  Aidan is with his friends somewhere off to the west.

Aidan's sitting with a small handful of his closest friends, off at the other side of the hall.  They seem rather subdued; most of the other campers seem to be keeping their distance.

Ava and Stacy are here.

That's not a verb I recognize.

>x stacy
You met Stacy last year, here at LEAP.  She's a skinny blonde girl with freckles and rather prominent front teeth.  She likes playing with gadgets, and is so full of nervous energy she could probably swallow an elephant and not gain an ounce of weight.  She's also wearing a deerstalker cap with a completely inappropriate daisy stuck into one flap.

>x lucian
Lucian's a little shrimp of a newbie.  He looks rather pale and colorless, with thin white-blonde hair plastered close to his scalp.  In short, he's rather typical bully-bait.

>[I think maybe their descriptions should be different at the end of the game. They've gone through an adventure with Daniel, and his feelings towards them have grown. That should be reflected.]

Aidan is your big brother.  He looks quite a lot like you, only taller and broader.  He's pretty cool when he isn't a raving murderous monster, which Dr Rose says is never going to happen again.  For now, he just looks grateful that anyone at all is willing to still be friends with him after everything that's happened in the past week.

>talk to stacy
"I'm surprised to see Aidan here," says Stacy, glancing over to where your brother is sitting.  "I should have thought they'd have kept him in the hospital until your folks came to get you.  Or maybe even shipping him straight home right away."

1. "Mom and Dad have been kind of tied up overseas.  I don't know how much they've been told about what's up with Aidan, anyway.  I guess they'll find out when they get here tomorrow."
2. "You're not still mad at him about SARG, are you?"
3. "I don't know.  I guess it's Dr Rose's decision, and she knows what she's doing."

>2
"You're not still mad at him about SARG, are you?"

Stacy relents a little.  "He did stop me just a few minutes ago to apologize," she admits.  She shrugs.  "He says he doesn't feel angry all the time anymore.  Is this true?"

You nod.  "The super-strength seems to be gone, too, so he's exactly back to the same old Aidan."

Stacy reaches around you to poke Ava, who squeaks and bats Stacy's hand away.

"Oh, here's a thought," says Stacy suddenly, "Daniel, could it be something at LEAP that set off your powers?"

1. "Eh?  What do you mean?"
2. "I'm pretty sure of it, actually."
3. "I don't think so.  Aidan's been coming here for years, and nothing's happened until now."

>3
"I don't think so.  Aidan's been coming here for years, and nothing's happened until now."

"Maybe he's just slower to react to it than you are."  Stacy doesn't look satisfied.  "Or maybe there's something different about this year."

"There are lots of things different about this year.  Do you think someone is causing this on purpose?"

"Maybe, but then, why pick on the two of you?  I mean, it would be less suspicious if it were two unrelated people, and if the two of you really were somehow genetically special, then it would be better to get you somewhere else.  Something here doesn't make sense."

"Stacy, you think too much."

>talk to stacy
There is no reply.

"So Daniel," says Lucian, "how awesome was it to go adventuring inside someone's brain?  Think you could do that in mine?"

1. "I don't think so.  Dr Rose thinks those funny emo powers kind of got blown away the last time I got blown out of Aidan's head."
2. "Yeah, sure.  Maybe."

>1
"I don't think so.  Dr Rose thinks those funny emo powers kind of got blown away the last time I got blown out of Aidan's head."

"Aw man, you mean they're gone?  For good?  No way!"

You shrug.  "They were getting kind of annoying anyway," you say, but Lucian still looks heartbroken at the news.

>talk to lucian
Lucian, who's been struggling with a few rashers of bacon, finally swallows the last of it and says, "one thing I still don't like about this place is the food.  I mean, is it always so ... sweet?  And not even like they put sugar, more like they used some sort of fake sugar instead."

1. "It's always been pretty awful, I thought."
2. "Yeah, but it's not so bad, really."

>1
"It's always been pretty awful, I thought."

"It's especially bad this year, though," says Ava.  "Must be a new cook.  Or maybe someone decided that fake sugar would be better for our health than real sugar."

"Yeah," says Stacy, rolling her eyes, "because we all need to go on diets.  They didn't have to put it in everything, though."

>talk to lucian
There is no reply.

>talk to ava
"One thing I don't understand," Ava muses, "is why the last Thief turned out to be Dr Rose.  I mean, what's the connection?"

1. "Um, she's the doctor who's been keeping him sedated all the time?"
2. "Um, she's the big authority figure here now that Damon Rose is gone?"
3. "Why does there have to be a connection?"
4. "Maybe she's secretly an evil supervillain who's been behind everything this year."

>4
"Maybe she's secretly an evil supervillain who's been behind everything this year."

Lucian gives a loud bark of laughter.  "Yeah right.  I mean, look at her, she's like somebody's favorite aunt."

Ava gives you a look of exasperation.  "Really, Daniel, if you can't take this seriously...."

"You're the only one who thinks it means anything, Ava," says Stacy.

"Okay, campers!  Enough breakfast!"  It's one of the counselors, Michelle Close.  She bustles along, hurrying everyone on to prepare for the upcoming exhibition and the end-of-camp banquet afterwards.  "You don't have to finish everything on your plates if you don't want to," she says generously, as Lucian attempts to gobble down the last of his breakfast.  "I know it's pretty awful."

"Hopefully the banquet will be better," mutters Stacy.

"It's catered by other people, in town.  After two weeks of this rubbish, I'm sure you won't want to miss the food at tonight's banquet!"

"Awesome!" says Lucian, pushing away his plate.

As everyone gets up from the table, you are suddenly hit with a strong sense of anticipation practically bouncing out of your friends and smashing heavily into your head.  Michelle notices your momentary unsteadiness.  "Hey ... Daniel, right?  You okay?"

"Yeah ... yeah.  Stood up to quickly, that's all."  Dr Rose did say that you might get flashes like this in the future, and that she would help you out if they didn't go away again.  Better not tell Michelle this: you don't want to wind up being stared at any more than you already are, and then there's Aidan to worry about....

But, as the emotion fades away, you know that this isn't over yet.  Not by a long shot....

Your Room
You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooler.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.

Aidan is here, swaying a little and looking like an enraged bull with a killer headache.

Your room is at this end of the Pits hallway, just to the south of here.  You've elected to cover your door with the biggest cutout of a werewolf that you can find, because werewolves are cool.  The hallway continues west, and a high window on the east wall looks out across Calvin Field North.  Right beside your room door is the fire stair leading back upstairs.

Pits Stairwell
This is the Pits, and evidently someone thought it would be a good idea to decorate the area dedicated to housing newbies with images taken from classic horror movies.  Frankenstein's monster looms over the doorway to the south, as if standing guard outside the Pits lobby, while werewolves and vampires romp away to the east and west.  The stairs themselves lead back upstairs to the wintery delights of the first floor.

Aidan's heavy footsteps come from the east.

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

As you run into this part of the hallway, one of the doors opens a crack.  Lucian pops his head out just long enough to see Aidan roaring up after you, and then he slams the door shut again.

Pits, West
This end of the Pits hallway is somewhat less spooky than the rest: the paper skeletons dancing across the walls all seem quite cheerful and not at all threatening.  Dim light filters in through a high window, through which you can see the bushes and assorted shrubbery growing up against the building.  From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.

There are exits east (to the pits stairwell), south (to Lucian's room) and up (to the first floor rooms) from here.

You hear Lucian's door open again, and Lucian himself running off in another direction.  You hope he's gone to get help.

Pits Stairwell
This is the Pits, and evidently someone thought it would be a good idea to decorate the area dedicated to housing newbies with images taken from classic horror movies.  Frankenstein's monster looms over the doorway to the south, as if standing guard outside the Pits lobby, while werewolves and vampires romp away to the east and west.  The stairs themselves lead back upstairs to the wintery delights of the first floor.

Aidan is here, swaying a little and looking like an enraged bull with a killer headache.

Familiar surroundings momentarily confuse him.

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

First Floor Rooms, East
This is the east end of the first floor dorm area.  Through the window at the end of the hall, you can see Calvin Field North and a bunch of campers running about in the summer sunshine.  In here, you are surrounded by images of people having snowball fights.  The fire stairs at this end of the hall go up and down.

Aidan's heavy footsteps come from the west.

"Hey!"  It's Brad, your counselor, minus the gum and the baseball cap.  He gets in between you and Aidan, shouting for Aidan to settle down.  Aidan has no intention of doing any such thing, and swings out at Brad instead.  He's slow, though, Brad ducks easily -- but then Aidan opens his hand and sweeps it back, catching Brad right in the chest.  WHAM!  Brad goes flying against the wall and slides unconscious to the floor.  You hear doors opening all up and down the hallway, and closing again, as Aidan turns his attention back to you....

You're at the west end of the first floor dorm area.  The winter sports theme continues on in spite of the summer sunshine streaming in through the window.  Aidan's room is to the north, flanked by a pair of matching hockey sticks, and you could take the fire stairs up or down.

Aidan's Room
Aidan shares this room with some guy whose name you never caught and whom you almost never see.  Aidan keeps his half of the room neat and spartan, almost as if he were expecting a military inspection at any moment.  The bedclothes look to be pulled tight enough to bounce a penny to the ceiling, and the desk is practically bare but for a few neatly regulationed necessities.  The door to the dorm corridor is back to the south.

Aidan is just beyond the door.

Still unsteady on his feet, Aidan prowls into the room after you.

>calm aidan
You try your best, but those feelings of anger and aggression seem to be pouring out of Aidan's psyche in never-ending waves.  The best you can do is to keep them from overwhelming that one bright spark of brotherly feeling....


Please press SPACE to continue.
But maybe that's all you need.

You hear the sirens a minute later, and then there's a police SWAT team swarming about.  You learn later that if Aidan had so much as taken a step towards you, he'd have been plugged full of lead from three different directions.  As it is, Dr Rose and her crack team of hospital orderlies eventually manage to push their way through the police red tape while you've got Aidan under control; he is given enough sedative to knock out an elephant, and taken back to the hospital.

From what you overhear from the orderlies, it looks like Aidan is building up a tolerance to the drugs that they've been using to keep him under: that's why he managed to escape from the hospital tonight.  It's only a matter of time before those drugs either stop working at all, or kill him without knocking him out.

"Have a sandwich," says Dr Rose.  "And some tea, perhaps?"

You help yourself to the first thing you've had in almost two weeks that doesn't taste of reverse-engineered sugar substitute.  As you nibble on the sandwich, Dr Rose pours out a cup of tea for herself and for you.  "I spoke with Ava," she says, looking serious, "and she tells me that you said something about having entered your brother's mind at one point.  Now, that is an aspect of your power that I had not anticipated, and I must say I find it quite fascinating.  It might, I suspect it might be of great use to Aidan right now.  Poor boy, I'm afraid there's no other way of dealing with the side effects of his emerging powers, as there was with you.  You're his last hope, Daniel."
University Hospital, Day 12 (Thursday) - Late afternoon

You're back in the same hospital room you woke up in last week, after you blacked out in the dining hall.  This time it's Aidan who's in the coffin-thing, pumped full of sedatives and tied down with so many heavy-duty cables that he looks like a mummy.  A small table and a couple of comfy chairs have been set up; Dr Rose is sitting in one chair, sipping at her tea.

Your Hospital Room
The room is, if anything, even more full of medical equipment than the last time you were here.  Aidan has been strapped into that coffin-thing that you woke up in back then, and trussed up so securely that it's a wonder they found anywhere to stick the wires monitoring his condition.  The door is back to the north.

A pair of comfortable chairs have been wheeled in, along with a small table.  Dr Rose sits in one chair, watching you with concern.

>save
Ok.

>focus
You can sense raw, directionless rage and aggression, mixed with a large dose of confusion, all of it fortunately damped down by the sedatives.  Now that you're aware of it, it becomes rather hard to ignore.  Dr Rose, watching you intently, encourages you to go on.  "You can do it, Daniel.  I know you can."

>g
It's just like the last time, only the aggressive emotions seem much more muted.  There is confusion and fear as well.  As you focus, Aidan's emotions become the only ones you are aware of, and then you're somewhere else...

Living Room
You are standing in your living room.  At least, it looks just like your living room back home, except for the large oriental rug sitting right where the stairs used to be.  The kitchen is off to the east, just as you remember it.  And Dad's trophy case, there in the corner, seems a little larger and more imposing than you remember, come to think of it.

Crossroads
You are standing at a crossroads.  A signpost indicates exits to the north, south, east, and west; the lamp perched on the top of the signpost does not illuminate enough of the area that you can actually see these exits, so having these indicators is a great help.  A spiral staircase leads back upwards.  You can faintly hear someone playing the blues on an alto sax.

You hesitantly walk off into the shadows, but turn back when it becomes clear that the lamplight from the signpost isn't going to penetrate far enough into the darkness to allow you to find anything.

You are standing in the middle of a forest, which is interesting because you cannot for the life of you remember the point at which the underground passageway, which you recall as being to the southeast, suddenly turned into a forest path.  Just as interesting is the gigantic tree here, towering high above all the other trees and penetrating the cloud cover far above.  Lifeless and hollow, it's only a matter of time before it collapses and buries half the forest beneath it.

Maintenance Room
This looks suspiciously like the bridge of your Dad's ship, at least what you remember of it from your visit to the naval base a couple of years ago.  Banks of controls line the walls, most of them blinking and beyond complicated.  One solitary terminal, separate from the others, seems simple enough, however.  Through a door to the northeast, which you do not remember opening to get in here, is the passage back to the fork.

The blue button sinks into the panel and locks into place with a soft click.  Off in the distance, you hear the grinding of heavy machinery.

Faint music wafts down from above, and the only visible exit is to the west.
