You hesitantly walk off into the shadows, but turn back when it becomes clear that the lamplight from the signpost isn't going to penetrate far enough into the darkness to allow you to find anything.

Fork
The shadowy passage from the east forks here, to the northwest and southwest.  A dim glow can be discerned at the end of the northwest fork; to the southwest, you can see only darkness.

Land Of The Dead
You are on a vast, perfectly flat plain of ice.  A platform of some sort has been built out of dry twigs in the middle of the plain; Aidan is lying on it, his arms crossed sedately over his chest.  The spirits of the dead crowd all around, chanting and wailing and gibbering, and preventing you from approaching the platform.

>x aidan
He looks grey and cold and lifeless.  His hands are crossed at the wrist, over his chest, fingers splayed.  For some reason, he's dressed up as Robin Hood.

Crossroads
You are standing at a crossroads.  A signpost indicates exits to the north, south, east, and west; the lamp perched on the top of the signpost does not illuminate enough of the area that you can actually see these exits, so having these indicators is a great help.  A spiral staircase leads back upwards.  You can faintly hear someone playing the blues on an alto sax.

You can see a brass lantern here.

Xroads
You are standing at an Xroads, which differ from a mere crossroads in that the roads go off diagonally, that is, to the northeast, southeast, and northwest.  Another narrow path goes back west to the crossroads.

Art Gallery
This was clearly an art gallery once, but the walls are bare: you can see squares and rectangles of unfaded wallpaper where paintings used to hang.  An archway in the northwest corner would take you back to the Xroads.

Only one painting still remains on the wall, and it's not a painting at all: it's a calligraphy scroll of some kind.

The heat is unbearable now.  And it's getting worse!  You burst into flames, which is not very pleasant, to say the least.



*** You have died ***

Please press SPACE to continue.



Or have you?  The light at the end of the tunnel soon revolves into the ceiling light of the hospital room, and you see Dr Rose looking down at you, her face full of concern.  "Oh dear," she says, "I suppose something went a little wrong in there?  Well, whenever you're ready, I hope you'll give it another try."

Your Hospital Room
The room is, if anything, even more full of medical equipment than the last time you were here.  Aidan has been strapped into that coffin-thing that you woke up in back then, and trussed up so securely that it's a wonder they found anywhere to stick the wires monitoring his condition.  The door is back to the north.

A pair of comfortable chairs have been wheeled in, along with a small table.  Dr Rose sits in one chair, watching you with concern.

>take off ring

>put ring on aidan
As you slip the ring onto Aidan's finger, a warm glow seems to spread from his hands and up to his face.  He looks somehow peaceful, as if he were just taking a nap.

Again, off in the distance.  The cawing of birds.

[You achieved a goal! (Revive Aidan)]

>[Hrm, I think that goal showed up at the wrong time. It should have appeared when I arrived at the land of the dead, along with "Banish The Evil Spirits.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[In general, the whole goal thing seems broken.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>put ring on aidan

As you slip the second ring onto Aidan's finger, the heat around him increases and you begin to see steam rising from his body.  His face flushes with fever.  Meanwhile, there's a dry, crackling sound coming from the platform now, and the smell of scorching.

>z

The heat around Aidan intensifies until it explodes with such force that you are violently thrown off your feet.  You slam painfully into a solid rock wall and lose consciousness....

Living Room
You are standing in your living room.  At least, it looks just like your living room back home, except for the trap door in the floor where the stairs used to be.  The kitchen is off to the east, just as you remember it.  And Dad's trophy case, there in the corner, seems a little larger and more imposing than you remember, come to think of it.

Curtain Room
You are in a perfectly cubical room, with wall-to-wall carpeting and wood-paneled walls.  An archway at the southwest corner leads back towards the Xroads.  The entire east wall is taken up by a red curtain that wafts and rustles in the nonexistent breeze.

Maintenance Room
This looks suspiciously like the bridge of your Dad's ship, at least what you remember of it from your visit to the naval base a couple of years ago.  Banks of controls line the walls, most of them blinking and beyond complicated.  One solitary terminal, separate from the others, seems simple enough, however.  Through a door to the northeast, which you do not remember opening to get in here, is the passage back to the fork.

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

With all these blinking lights, it's surprising that you needed to bring a light source into this room to dispel the darkness.

>x terminal
This terminal consists of a monitor screen, a red button, and a blue button.  The screen shows six boxes, labeled A to F: A and B in the top row, and the remaining four in the bottom row.  Horizontal lines connect boxes A to B,  E to F, and D to E.  A vertical line joins boxes A and D.

>e

Lake Shore
You stand on the shores of what should more properly be called a sea: it is enormous, its far shores lost beyond the reach of any light.  The ceiling of the cavern is lost in the darkness as well; it is so high up that it is entirely possible that there is in fact no ceiling, and that the darkness above is a starless, moonless sky.  Faint music wafts down from above, and the only visible exit is to the west.

>x lake
The lake is dark and inky, and covered over with a thick layer of ice.  Curiously, the marbled patterns of bubbles in the ice seem to form the vague appearance of a face.  A face wearing a domino mask.

>x ice
It seems solid enough.

>walk on lake
You must supply a noun.
  
>enter lake
You walk out across the ice, and despite your best efforts to keep in a straight line, find yourself emerging right where you started.

Crossroads
You are standing at a crossroads.  A signpost indicates exits to the north, south, east, and west; the lamp perched on the top of the signpost does not illuminate enough of the area that you can actually see these exits, so having these indicators is a great help.  A spiral staircase leads back upwards.  You can faintly hear someone playing the blues on an alto sax.

>w

Fork
The shadowy passage from the east forks here, to the northwest and southwest.  A dim glow can be discerned at the end of the northwest fork; to the southwest, you can see only darkness.

>sw

Maintenance Room
This looks suspiciously like the bridge of your Dad's ship, at least what you remember of it from your visit to the naval base a couple of years ago.  Banks of controls line the walls, most of them blinking and beyond complicated.  One solitary terminal, separate from the others, seems simple enough, however.  Through a door to the northeast, which you do not remember opening to get in here, is the passage back to the fork.

>push blue
The blue button unlocks and pops out again.  Off in the distance, you hear the grinding of heavy machinery.

>push red
The red button sinks into the panel and locks into place with a soft click.  Off in the distance, you hear the grinding of heavy machinery.

Thief's Den
You have managed to find your way into the thief's den, a seedy little place higher than it is wide and lined with shelves displaying the thief's ill-gotten gains.  The only piece of furniture appears to be a dirty mattress on the floor.  A spiral stair winds back up to the twisty passages of the maze.

Surprised, the thief twists to his feet, pulling a knife.

You can also see some night vision goggles here.

>kill thief
Oh, hey, you know kung fu.  Since when did you know kung fu?  Clearly Aidan must think you ought to know kung fu, because here you do.  You show the thief.

WHAM!

The thief rolls to one side as he lands, and is quickly on his feet again.  He shakes his head, as if to clear it, and aims a deadly jab at your throat.  You manage to dodge the worst of it, but it still clips you quite painfully on the shoulder.

>g
THUD.

The thief scrambles to his feet again, and adopts a defensive position.

>g
CRACK!

The thief tries to get up, but this time your awesome in-this-world-only kung fu skills prove too much for him, and he collapses, unconscious.

[You achieved a goal! (Defeat the Thief)]

>remove mask
You can't see any such thing.

>get mask
Black smoke begins to emit from the fallen thief, only slightly at first, then billowing out in greater and greater amounts.  Again you hear the distant sound of cawing birds, but this time, the sound draws closer, as if they come for you.  As the cold smoke fills the room, it begins to circle and swirl, until resolving itself into a mass of inky-black birds, cawing, echoing, shrieking within the small space.  You duck down, cover your head and your ears, await some sort of onslaught, but, it does not come.  The black flock thins on its own, not so much flying down the only exit, as disappearing through the rock itself.

The ground just drops away a short distance away from the house, descending straight down into the clouds miles below.  The only solid object you can see beyond the clouds is a mountain far off into the distance.  The only way back into the house is through the kitchen window.

The thief lunges at Aidan, who dives for the ground and kicks out at the thief.  The kick manages to catch the thief in the shoulder, sending him spinning off to one side.  Unfortunately, this does not seem to slow the thief down in the slightest.

>help aidan

Aidan engages the thief in a blur of flying fists and feet, and for a moment the two of them are moving so quickly you're not sure where one of them ends and the other begins.  And when they finally disengage, you can't tell if either of them has managed to land a blow on the other.

>x aidan
He doesn't look very happy to be here.  Then again, who would?  Fortunately for everyone, he's also unconscious and drooling slightly.  He's being kept sedated, but goodness only knows how long that will last.

Aidan catches your eye.  "We're too evenly matched," he says, in between deflecting the thief's knife and trying to land a punch, "I could really use an edge here...."

>[that should work]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>give sword to aidan
You put the sword on the ground and slide it over to Aidan, who kicks it up into his hands and swings it up to block the Thief's knife.  He's much faster than you are, given the super-speed and super-strength, and you can hear the sword whistling through the air as it whirls, a blue blur around the Thief.  In less than a minute, the Thief's knife goes flying off into the darkness, and the Thief himself is cut down.

There's no blood.

Aidan stands over the Thief, leaning on the sword and panting.  He flashes you a familiar smile.  "Thanks, Daniel.  He almost had me there.  If you hadn't passed me the sword...."  He shakes his head.  "Now, let's see who this fellow is behind his mask."  Leaning down, he pulls off the Thief's mask, revealing the face of ... Dr Claudia Rose.

The scene wavers and dissolves all around you.  Aidan is saying something, but you can't hear him.  And in a moment, you are back in the hospital room, looking at the real Dr Rose, who is smiling quite happily.  "You did it, Daniel!  I knew you could do it!  Look, your brother's looking more peaceful already."

It's true.  Aidan's still unconscious, but he looks a great deal more relaxed, with the same expression of peace that you saw when you put the ring on him back there in the Land of the Dead.  Whatever was going wrong in his head, it's over now.

"For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's...."

You wake up to face the last day of LEAP.  Oh, a big parade, like the one in your dream, would have been nice.  But it looks as if you've been totally out of it since saving Aidan from himself; in fact, Dr Rose's congratulations really were pretty much the last thing you remember before waking up just now, three hours before breakfast, with Dr Rose hovering nearby.  She doesn't appear to have slept all night.

After two hours of various tests and stuff, you and Aidan are both shipped back to camp, and then it's off to breakfast while ignoring all the whispers and the odd looks.  You find a seat in a far corner of the dining hall, while Aidan falls in with some friends who don't think he's going to rip their heads off if they look at him funny.  Almost immediately, Ava and Stacy sit down on either side of you, and Lucian sits himself across the table from you.  At least some people don't think you're an all-out freak....

LEAP, Day 13 (Friday) - Breakfast

You are sitting with Ava and Stacy and Lucian; otherwise, there's no-one else at the table.  Somewhere else in the dining hall, Aidan is sitting with a small handful of friends who still think he's okay, murderous psycho rages or not.  A lot of the people have finished breakfast and moved on, but you've been busy telling your friends about your adventures through Aidan's mindscape.

Dining Hall
You are sitting between Ava and Stacy.  Lucian is sitting across from you, half-hidden behind a stack of pancakes.  Aidan is with his friends somewhere off to the west.

Aidan's sitting with a small handful of his closest friends, off at the other side of the hall.  They seem rather subdued; most of the other campers seem to be keeping their distance.

Ava and Stacy are here.

>[okay, with that I think I'll wrap up my work with this build.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>save
Ok.

>quit
Are you sure you want to quit? y
