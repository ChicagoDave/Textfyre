It's your second year at the LEAP summer camp, and so far it's been as great as you remember last year to have been.  Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls "your girlfriends", much to your embarrassment) are here again.  You spent yesterday catching up on the news in between options and classes, and now you're settling in with the smug sensation of not being a raw newbie any more.

The LEAP summer camp isn't quite the same as most summer camps.  LEAP is an acronym for "Learning Enrichment Activity Program"; the brainchild of world-renowned educator Professor Damon Rose, it is housed on the campus of the University of Colorado at Valmont, and was created for Gifted and Talented Kids (gosh, that sounds impressive) to expand their horizons and encourage them to stretch their mental capabilities.

Whatever. That's all in the promotional flyers. You just know that you're in for two weeks of the sort of interesting classes you don't get in school, and a bunch of fun options with which to fill up the free time after classes.  This evening, for instance, you've signed up for a scavenger hunt....


Please press SPACE to continue.
LEAP, Day 2.  Evening.

"Okay, kids!" Michelle, the counselor in charge of the scavenger hunt option waves her hands to settle the crowd around you, before finally remembering her whistle.  A brief fweep sweeps through the room.  "Okay, does everyone have their list?  Everyone good?  Okay!  You have until 8:25 pm to find everything on your lists, return here, and show me your lists so I can check them.  So synchronize your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!"

Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.  Everyone except you: there's a sudden pressure in the back of your throat, and you feel dizzy ... it only lasts a moment, but by then everyone else is gone, leaving you alone.

Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

Michelle Close leans against the side of the desk, chewing on a pencil.

>x michelle
Michelle Close is one of the counselors.  She's slightly untidy-looking, with a big explosion of curly black hair and a pencil tucked behind one ear.

>ask michelle about hunt
There is no reply.

>ask michelle about leap
There is no reply.

>ask michelle about me
"You are yourself, of course."  Michelle smiles encouragingly.  It's clear the only thing she really knows about you is your name.

>ask michelle about herself
She does not reply.

She glances at her watch and adds, "Time's a-wasting, Daniel!  Have you found everything on your list yet?"

>ask michelle about ava
There is no reply.

>ask michelle about stacy
There is no reply.

>[okay, there are some gaps in NPC responses here]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x pencil
It's a yellow stub of an HB pencil.  The eraser is gone from one end, and it looks like someone's been sharpening it with their teeth.

>i
You are carrying:
  an unread list of items for the Scavenger Hunt
  a few dollars

>x money
You see nothing special about the dollars.

>x list
A newspaper
A feather
A flag
A star
A dinosaur
A hat
Something that was once alive

The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.

>e
You step out into the bright sunshine.

Calvin Field, North
Claremont Hall, to the north, looms over the entire length of Calvin Field, which continues to the south.  Jacobs Hall is back to the west, and the dining hall is to the east.  A fountain takes up space right where all the paths meet, so there usually aren't that many people running around and tearing up the grass.  Right now, though, there are several people running around, playing Myth Tag, and there's nothing the fountain can do about it.

>x grass
It's green, which means it's not quite dead yet, despite the best efforts of the Myth Tag players.

>pull grass
Those are fixed in place.

>[I should be able to yank the grass to get it into my inventory]
You typed a rather long command and I didn't understand it. It's better to stick to simpler things like TAKE FLOWER, for example.

>[That must be the small kindnesses at work. Very nice Mr. Reed]
You typed a rather long command and I didn't understand it. It's better to stick to simpler things like TAKE FLOWER, for example.

>[But I'm going to keep typing these long comments regardless.]
You typed a rather long command and I didn't understand it. It's better to stick to simpler things like TAKE FLOWER, for example.

>get grass
They're hardly portable.

>[Also, a bit weird to refer to the grass as a "they"]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x fountain
The fountain consists of a wide, shallow basin and a modern sculpture that, to you, looks a lot like Big Foot taking a shower.  It's not running right now.

A pair of first-year campers come tearing past you, yelling at the top of their lungs.  Looks like they've decided to take the unoffered "Hide and Seek" option.  You're about to yell at them to settle down when the world suddenly turns mauve.  It only lasts a split-second, but leaves you feeling a little dizzy and disoriented.
You feel an odd, ticklish sensation on the tip of your nose as two of the older campers walk past, and then your head begins to hurt.  The two campers laugh nastily when they see you stumble, but keep moving.  Fortunately for you, the headache disappears as quickly as it appeared.

>[Both nice incidents. It seems wrong that they're piled atop one another.]
You typed a rather long command and I didn't understand it. It's better to stick to simpler things like TAKE FLOWER, for example.

>x sculpture
You can't see such a thing.

That's not a verb I recognize.

>[testing what takes up game time]
You can't ask direct questions to the game. Type a verb - noun command like EXAMINE FLOWER, for example to interact with the story world.

>pull grass
Those are fixed in place.

>[How much of a pain in the ass would it be to have these non-actions not take up game time? In a timed chapter like this, it seems unfair to have a minute elapse when basically the parser has refused to cooperate.]
>HOW MUCH OF A PAIN WOULD IT BE TO HAVE THESE NON-ACTIONS NOT TAKE UP GAME TIME
You typed a rather long command and I didn't understand it. It's better to stick to simpler things like TAKE FLOWER, for example.

>[Okay, that I do not like. It feels quite prudish to me to have the game make a big point of excising my "naughty" words. For god's sake we're aiming at middle schoolers here. One of the first great delights of any kid playing IF is when it gives some
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[snarky response to swearing.]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>fuck
I'm sorry if you're feeling frustrated. If you like, you can type SAVE to store your progress to a file (in most interpreters), then RESTORE to come back to it later. In the meantime, you might try searching the web to see if there are hints available.

>[According to me, that should be adjusted to be much snappier and much less teacherly.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>you are a pain in the ass
>YOU ARE A PAIN 
Please rephrase your command to start with an imperative verb, like LOOK.

>fuck you

>[I'm really not frustrated, just experimenting.]
Please rephrase your command to start with an imperative verb, like LOOK.

>shit
I'm sorry if you're feeling frustrated. If you like, you can type SAVE to store your progress to a file (in most interpreters), then RESTORE to come back to it later. In the meantime, you might try searching the web to see if there are hints available.

You're plainly inedible.

>x tag
It's sort of like normal tag, except you can declare yourself "safe" by crouching down and naming a mythological creature.  No repeats, though: one of the counselors is keeping track of what's been named so far.

>[Might be fun to have periodic atmosphere messages with a kid shouting out "Pegasus!" or some such.]
You typed a rather long command and I didn't understand it. It's better to stick to simpler things like TAKE FLOWER, for example.

You can't see such a thing.

Calvin Field, South
During the school year, this part of Calvin Field gets pretty scuffed up by students playing football or whatever inter-department sports tickle their fancy at the time.  Right now, it's getting scuffed up by people playing flag football.  The university caretakers must be wondering why they even bother to replant the grass every Spring.  The less scuffed-up part of Calvin Field is to the north, and the front lawn of Jacobs Hall is to the west.

Your counselor, Brad Kramer, stands beside a large pile of red flags, watching the flag football game with a whistle tucked between his lips.

>get grass
They're hardly portable.

>pull grass
Those are fixed in place.

>[If I can't pull the grass, I'm not sure the "something that was once alive" goal can be achieved, and therefore this chapter might not be "winnable."]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[On the other hand, maybe I should just scrap that goal altogether. As Ron pointed out, LOTS of things could fit that -- the newspaper, the cloth, even the dollars.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[I wanted to encourage creative answers, but I don't think I designed that bit very well.]
You typed a rather long command and I didn't understand it. It's better to stick to simpler things like TAKE FLOWER, for example.

>[Okay, designer decision. Please get rid of the "something that was once alive
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[grr fat finger. Please get rid of the "something that was once alive" goal.]
>GRR FAT FINGER. GET RID OF THE SOMETHING THAT WAS ONCE ALIVE GOAL.
You typed a rather long command and I didn't understand it. It's better to stick to simpler things like TAKE FLOWER, for example.

>[hey, now... wha? I have to say I really do not like this "hey I'm rewriting your command because I can do it better than you" jazz. If you don't like something about what I said, respond to that thing rather than just revising it out of existence.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[For instance, in City of Secrets, Emily detects the words "please" in a command and says something like, "Your politeness is appreciated, but there's no need to type "please" before your commands."]
You can't talk to the list of items for the Scavenger Hunt.

>x brad
Brad Kramer, your counselor for this year, looks like a typical jock, though he's been pretty awesome so far.  Normally, he's never seen without a baseball cap and that ever-present wad of chewing gum lodged in one cheek.  The gum's still there, and somehow he still manages to chew it while still holding his referee's whistle between his lips, but at the moment the cap is gone.

>goals
Goals: 
  find a newspaper
  find a feather
  find a flag
  find a star
  find a dinosaur
  find a hat
  find something that was once alive

Front Lawn
A whole bunch of walls have been temporarily erected all over the front lawn for the Graffiti Art option.  The smell of paint is everywhere, not to mention the hiss of spray cans.  Passersby on Second Avenue -- to the northwest -- will no doubt find this all very interesting.  A flagpole rises up from the maze of makeshift walls here, while Calvin Field and the more athletic options are off to the east.

>w
There are exits east (to calvin field) and northwest from here.

>nw

Second Avenue
Second Avenue runs north and south along the edge of a cliff: to the west is a sharp drop down (don't even try) onto the rooftops of the buildings along First Avenue, and beyond those are the jagged ridges of the Rockies.  Jacobs Hall -- the old part, anyway -- is open to the east, and its front lawn spreads out to the southeast.  You can also go northeast, squeezing around the newer part of Jacobs Hall to the courtyard beyond.

Conveniently, a bus shelter with a newspaper vending machine is almost directly outside the Hall.

>x vending machine
Insert the appropriate change, get your daily dose of gloom and doom.

>open vending machine
Not without paying first!

>get newspaper
The vending machine isn't open.

>put dollar in vending machine
It appears that the vending machine was not designed to accept those.

>e
You leave behind the bright sunshine.

Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

Michelle Close leans against the side of the desk, chewing on a pencil.

>ask michelle for change
"What do you want it for, Daniel?"

1. "Snacks!"
2. "Soda pop!"
3. "Coffee!"
4. "Newspaper!"

>3
"Coffee!"

"Coffee?  Daniel, there aren't any coin-operated coffee machines here.  I know, I've checked."  She glances back at the stairs and mutters, "none that serve anything remotely drinkable, anyway."

>ask michelle for change
"What do you want it for, Daniel?"

1. "Snacks!"
2. "Soda pop!"
3. "Coffee!"
4. "Newspaper!"

>4
"Newspaper!"

"Why Daniel, I am so very pleased that you're taking an interest in current events!"  She drops just enough change for the newspaper machine into your hand, and winks.  "At least, I'm sure that's why you want a newspaper, and it's not because of anything so silly as a scavenger hunt."

>w
You step out into the bright sunshine.

You can also go northeast, squeezing around the newer part of Jacobs Hall to the courtyard beyond.

Conveniently, a bus shelter with a newspaper vending machine is almost directly outside the Hall.

>buy newspaper
The vending machine isn't open.

>[That should encapsulate paying for and taking the newspaper. It's a reasonable command to handle, and there's no reason to enforce unnecessarily fiddly interaction.]
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>open machine
Not without paying first!

>put coins in machine
You insert the appropriate change, and the glass front of the vending machine clicks open just wide enough for you to extract the day's newspaper.  Then it snaps shut again.

[You achieved a goal! (finding a newspaper)]

>fold newspaper
You pull out a section of the newspaper and quickly fold it into a sailboat.  Or a hat, one of the two: you never did figure out how to make those two things any different from each other.

[You achieved a goal! (finding a hat)]

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

>w

First Floor Rooms, West
You're at the west end of the first floor dorm area.  The winter sports theme continues on in spite of the summer sunshine streaming in through the window.  Aidan's room is to the north, flanked by a pair of matching hockey sticks, and you could take the fire stairs up or down.

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>u

Second Floor Lobby
Hooray for Hollywood!  The words are emblazoned right across the wall, over a cutout of Audrey Hepburn holding a pouch full of smaller cutouts of other Hollywood stars.  The glamour continues east and west, to where the younger girl campers are roomed, while the stairs go up and down.

A few tables have been set up here for the RPG option, and the campers involved seem thoroughly absorbed in the unfolding story.

>get stars
(the images of Hollywood stars)
You take a cutout picture of Charlie Chaplin.

[You achieved a goal! (finding a star)]

>u

Third Floor Lobby
This is where the older girls have their rooms.  The walls are painted a very dark blue, and there are planets, stars and all things space-age stuck all over the place.  A cutout of an astronaut holds out a pouch full of astronomical bits; the corridor itself extends east and west, and the stairs continue down to the rest of the dorms and up to the roof.

Under a particularly starry patch of ceiling, a group of campers, including your brother Aidan, are engaged in some freeform improvised poetry.  This is the Rap Session option, you think.

As you enter the area, you experience a momentary headache and the urge to sneeze.  The feeling disappears quickly, but evidently not quickly enough because Aidan clearly seems to have noticed something wrong.  He breaks away from the rest of his option and comes up to you. 

"Hey, Daniel, you okay?"

1. "Yeah, I'm fine."
2. "No, I'm getting these dizzy spells and headaches."

>2
"No, I'm getting these dizzy spells and headaches."

Aidan frowns.  "Could be something you ate.  Brad Kramer's your counselor, isn't he?  Want me to go get him?"

1. "Thanks, but I think I'll be able to find him myself."
2. "No, I'll be fine.  It's nothing, really."
3. "Uh, no, thanks.  (Aidan, you're embarrassing me!)"

>2
"No, I'll be fine.  It's nothing, really."

"Whatever you say, tough guy."  Aidan ruffles your hair, and for a moment, but only a moment, something buzzes in your ears.  Aidan resumes his seat with the other rappers.

>get stars

You take a five-pointed star cutout.

You step out into the bright sunshine.

Rooftop
The rooftop is only accessible when there's an activity or option that uses it.  Otherwise, it's off-limits, not that you can really imagine why anyone would want to come up here.  It's all black gravel and tar.  The courtyard downstairs is way more pleasant.

The Eggdrop option is busy tossing boxes of eggs over the parapet: a table has been set up as well, and is covered with artsy-craftsy materials with which a number of campers are building egg-preservation containers.

As you emerge into the sunlight, you feel a momentary dizziness that makes you almost want to hurl.  The feeling is gone very quickly, but your heart is left pumping as though you'd just run a couple of miles.

>get feather
You take a feather.
