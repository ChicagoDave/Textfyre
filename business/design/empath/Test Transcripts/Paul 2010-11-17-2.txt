You typed a rather long command and I didn't understand it. It's better to stick to simpler things like TAKE FLOWER, for example.

Ava And Stacy's Room
Ava and Stacy both keep their respective sides of the room perfectly tidy; it's rather intimidating, actually.  You can tell whose side is whose by the stuff they keep on their desks: Ava has a CD player, an assortment of CDs, and a few books; Stacy has a few broken gadgets that she's fixing, probably because she broke them to begin with.  One of them has taped a poster for "Casablanca" on the door to the south.

Ava and Stacy trail along behind you.  

>x cds
Ava's on a folk song kick right now.  It's only a matter of time before she turns country-and-western, you think.

>x gadgets
Stacy's very fond of taking things apart and putting them back together again.  She's going to become a mad scientist and take over the world one day, if you and Ava don't watch her.

>s

Second Floor Rooms, East
The girls at this end of the corridor seem to prefer movie posters to cutouts of actors.  The only cutout here is a life-size Humphrey Bogart, on the door to the fire stairs.  Opposite Bogey, to the north, is Ava and Stacy's room, while behind Bogey are stairs going up and down.  And at the end of the corridor is, of course, the window overlooking Calvin Field, and stardom continues back to the west.

Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. 

>x ava
You met Ava last year, here at LEAP.  She's a rosy-cheeked girl with long, brown pigtails; since last year, she's also acquired a pair of glasses that, she claims, make her look like a young Nana Mouskouri.

>x stacy
You met Stacy last year, here at LEAP.  She's a skinny blonde girl with freckles and rather prominent front teeth.  She likes playing with gadgets, and is so full of nervous energy she could probably swallow an elephant and not gain an ounce of weight.  She's also wearing a deerstalker cap with a completely inappropriate daisy stuck into one flap.

Third Floor Rooms, East
This end of the corridor looks like the inside of a space shuttle.  Someone's gone to great care to create window-like frames for the stars and planets and whatnot; even the window overlooking Calvin Field has been made to look like a space shuttle viewport.  Outer Space is back to the west; presumably the planet Earth is down the stairs.

You sense nothing untoward or out of the ordinary here.

Third Floor Lobby
This is where the older girls have their rooms.  The walls are painted a very dark blue, and there are planets, stars and all things space-age stuck all over the place.  A cutout of an astronaut holds out a pouch full of astronomical bits; the corridor itself extends east and west, and the stairs continue down to the rest of the dorms and up to the roof.

Second Floor Lobby
Hooray for Hollywood!  The words are emblazoned right across the wall, over a cutout of Audrey Hepburn holding a pouch full of smaller cutouts of other Hollywood stars.  The glamour continues east and west, to where the younger girl campers are roomed, while the stairs go up and down.

It looks like the folks who took yesterday's RPG option have decided to reconvene and keep playing.

Ava and Stacy trail along behind you.

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  

"Daniel," says Ava, "Daniel, you're getting that funny look again.  Is whatever-it-is somewhere around here?"

"Try to focus," says Stacy. 

>taste air
You can't see any such thing.

>[we should handle that since we're talking about a taste in the air. Not to say we should alias it to focus. "Taste in the air is a metaphor."]
You typed a rather long command and I didn't understand it. It's better to stick to simpler things like TAKE FLOWER, for example.

>focus on stacy
You think you hear crickets chirping.

>focus on me
You space out for a few seconds.  Incredibly, you now know exactly what you're thinking.

>[I like that response and think it's really funny, but it could constitute a bit of a spoiler before Daniel (or the player) understands what focusing actually does. Perhaps a different response prior to that time.]

>focus
Concentrating on the flavor, you sense an undercurrent of salt tears.  Both sour and salt seem to form a line between the info desk and the stairs going down. 

"It's a trail," you say.  "It goes down the stairs and back to the info desk."

"I know we said we'd go look around the info desk," says Stacy, "but if this is a trail of some sort, I wonder where it leads."

Ava shrugs.  "Up to you, Daniel.  Off to the info desk, or down the stairs?"

Pits Stairwell
This is the Pits, and evidently someone thought it would be a good idea to decorate the area dedicated to housing newbies with images taken from classic horror movies.  Frankenstein's monster looms over the doorway to the south, as if standing guard outside the Pits lobby, while werewolves and vampires romp away to the east and west.  The stairs themselves lead back upstairs to the wintery delights of the first floor.

There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.

Pits, West
This end of the Pits hallway is somewhat less spooky than the rest: the paper skeletons dancing across the walls all seem quite cheerful and not at all threatening.  Dim light filters in through a high window, through which you can see the bushes and assorted shrubbery growing up against the building.  From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.

There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  

Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. 

>focus
Concentrating on the flavor, you sense an undercurrent of salt tears.  They trail off to the east, but seem strongest around one of the doors to the south. 

"Whatever it is, it's strongest around that door."

Ava and Stacy exchange glances, and before you can stop her, Stacy is knocking on the door.  "We've come this far.  I want to know what's at the end of --"

Stacy quickly shuts up when the door opens a crack, and a rather timid little guy peeks out at you.  He fairly reeks of that mysterious sour-salty air.  And now you think you can hear some sort of twittering in the background, too.  It occurs to you that you remember seeing him up at the egg-drop option yesterday, though he certainly wasn't giving off this... whatever it is... back then.

"Hi," says Ava, who seems to recognize the guy.  "Lucian, isn't it?  We met yesterday at the sign-ups.  Anyway, these are my friends Daniel and Stacy.  May we come in for a moment?"

Lucian lets the door swing half-open and sighs resignedly.  "Sure, if you want," he says, retreating back into the room.  The three of you follow him inside.

Lucian's Room
It's another dorm room, not much different from your own.  Lucian's desk and bed are on one side; a CD player, playing Bill Withers' "Lean On Me" over and over, sits on his desk beside a couple of framed photographs.

There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.

>x lucian
Lucian's a little shrimp of a newbie.  He looks rather pale and colorless, with thin white-blonde hair plastered close to his scalp.  In short, he's rather typical bully-bait.

[A new goal was added: find out what happened to Lucian]

There are two of them.  One appears to be a class photograph taken a year or two ago: there's an older man, maybe in his fifties, surrounded by a bunch of kids, in front of a blackboard.  The other is much older, judging by the clothes and hair, and shows a cheerful little old lady sitting on a bench in a colorful flower garden.

"Yeah.  She died."  The sour taste in the air is almost overwhelmed by a different, marshy sort of smell, yet you somehow know that the two sensations are somehow related.  Ava is instantly consoling Lucian, and finding all the right words that you can't think of.

"Was she a gardener?" asks Ava.  "That's a beautiful garden she's in."

"Yeah, yeah she was.  She was an environmentalist.  That's why she...."  Lucian stops.  "Never mind."

1. "Why what?"

>1
"Why what?"

Lucian shakes his head.  Stacy looks a little annoyed and says, "you know, if you don't tell us what's upsetting you, we can't help you.  So why don't you just spit it out and get it over with?"

Lucian looks a little angry and says, "Stop picking on me!  You're just like those bullies at dinner!  They made me give them my grandmother's earth crystal and I bet you want me to pay some sort of fine for being a loser.  Well I've had it.  Just go away and leave me alone!"

>["Yeah. She died." is a pretty abrupt and non-sequitur-ish answer to asking about the garden. It might make sense to put some words in Daniel's mouth for these conversations. "I like your pictures. Is the woman in the garden...?"]

Lucian picks up the class photo.  "That's Peter," he says, pointing to the teacher smiling up from one side of the group.  For a moment, the sour taste in the air disappears.  "He lets us call him by his first name, and he's the most awesome teacher ever."  Then Lucian looks sad again.  "He's the one who said I was smart enough to come here, and he went and pulled all sorts of strings.  I should be grateful, I suppose."

1. "But you're not?  Why?"

"But you're not?  Why?"

Pits, East
Your room is at this end of the Pits hallway, just to the south of here.  You've elected to cover your door with the biggest cutout of a werewolf that you can find, because werewolves are cool.  The hallway continues west, and a high window on the east wall looks out across Calvin Field North.  Right beside your room door is the fire stair leading back upstairs.

Your Room
You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooler.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.

Pits Lobby Central
This section of the Pits is part of the older part of Jacobs Hall, and therefore cut up into more interesting shapes.  There are a bunch of storerooms, all of them locked, and then two very large halls to the east and west.  A passage to the north leads back to the main stairwell.  Apparently there used to be another staircase here going up, but it was ripped out to give this place a little more elbow room.

Info Desk
The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.

It's another dorm room, not much different from your own.  Lucian's desk and bed are on one side; a CD player, playing Bill Withers' "Lean On Me" over and over, sits on his desk beside a couple of framed photographs.

Lucian's sour, vaguely nauseating trail is in the air.  

Ava and Stacy are here.

Pits, West
This end of the Pits hallway is somewhat less spooky than the rest: the paper skeletons dancing across the walls all seem quite cheerful and not at all threatening.  Dim light filters in through a high window, through which you can see the bushes and assorted shrubbery growing up against the building.  From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.

Concentrating on the flavor, you sense an undercurrent of salt tears.  They trail off to the east, but seem strongest around one of the doors to the south. 

"Whatever it is, it's strongest around that door."

Ava and Stacy exchange glances, and before you can stop her, Stacy is knocking on the door.  "We've come this far.  I want to know what's at the end of --"

Stacy quickly shuts up when the door opens a crack, and a rather timid little guy peeks out at you.  He fairly reeks of that mysterious sour-salty air.  And now you think you can hear some sort of twittering in the background, too.  It occurs to you that you remember seeing him up at the egg-drop option yesterday, though he certainly wasn't giving off this... whatever it is... back then.

"Hi," says Ava, who seems to recognize the guy.  "Lucian, isn't it?  We met yesterday at the sign-ups.  Anyway, these are my friends Daniel and Stacy.  May we come in for a moment?"

Lucian lets the door swing half-open and sighs resignedly.  "Sure, if you want," he says, retreating back into the room.  The three of you follow him inside.

Pits Stairwell
This is the Pits, and evidently someone thought it would be a good idea to decorate the area dedicated to housing newbies with images taken from classic horror movies.  Frankenstein's monster looms over the doorway to the south, as if standing guard outside the Pits lobby, while werewolves and vampires romp away to the east and west.  The stairs themselves lead back upstairs to the wintery delights of the first floor.

Concentrating on the flavor, you sense an undercurrent of salt tears.  Both sour and salt seem to trail off to the west and to the stairs going up.

Pits, East
Your room is at this end of the Pits hallway, just to the south of here.  You've elected to cover your door with the biggest cutout of a werewolf that you can find, because werewolves are cool.  The hallway continues west, and a high window on the east wall looks out across Calvin Field North.  Right beside your room door is the fire stair leading back upstairs.

First Floor Rooms, East
This is the east end of the first floor dorm area.  Through the window at the end of the hall, you can see Calvin Field North and a bunch of campers running about in the summer sunshine.  In here, you are surrounded by images of people having snowball fights.  The fire stairs at this end of the hall go up and down.

You sense nothing untoward or out of the ordinary here.

There are exits south, west (to the first floor midpoint), up (to the second floor rooms) and down (to pits) from here.

It seems to be locked.

First Floor Midpoint
The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.

First Floor Rooms, West
You're at the west end of the first floor dorm area.  The winter sports theme continues on in spite of the summer sunshine streaming in through the window.  Aidan's room is to the north, flanked by a pair of matching hockey sticks, and you could take the fire stairs up or down.

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Please rephrase your command to start with an imperative verb, like LOOK.

>n
Aidan isn't in right now, and you shouldn't be poking around in his room while he's gone.  Even if he is your brother.  Especially if he's your brother.  And anyway, the door is locked.

>knock on door
You get no reply.

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>[much further in the game.]
That's not a verb I recognize.

>[So that's it for me. I'm mailing off these transcripts now.]
You typed a rather long command and I didn't understand it. It's better to stick to simpler things like TAKE FLOWER, for example.

Are you sure you want to quit? yes
