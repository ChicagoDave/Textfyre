You nimbly hop up on top of the crates; from there, it's only a short scramble to the roof of the market.

Outer Market Roof
The tiled roof of the storehouse is steep, but there's just enough purchase for you to scramble up to the top and get a look around. From here you have a good view of the market's northwest junction and the gate to Lord's Road heading north.

A group of tough-looking mercenaries has gathered at the Northwest Junction. One of them is barking orders at the others in an angry voice.

"...we know he stalks Grubber's most mornings, so spread out quick, cover all streets from the square," growls one of them, evidently the group's leader.

>[4] z
Time passes.

The leader spits on the dusty ground. "Keep your eyes open and don't take guff. But for the love of Brigid, keep your tempers and your knives covered unless you really need em. Ain't bein paid to toss the locals."

>[5] z
Time passes.

"And keep sharp!" the leader snaps. "Remember this is a kid we're lookin' for. Kids move fast, stay out of sight, slip through crowds easy. I find out later he got away under your nose, I'll have it off!"

Suddenly, that bit of apple you swallowed a minute ago turns into a cold, hard chunk in your belly.

>[6] z
Time passes.

"Now, everyone memorize the description." The leader pulls a dirty, folded bit of parchment from his belt and squints at it. "Short brown hair," he reads, haltingly. "Green eyes. Slight of build. 'Tween seven and eight spans high." He holds his hand out flat, at what happens to be exactly your height. "Wears a gray cloak."

He refolds the parchment and jams it back into his belt. "You dims got all that?"

The others nod.

>[7] z
Time passes.

"Okay, go!" barks the leader, and the mercenaries set out in several directions, moving at a brisk walk. Two men position themselves at the gate to Lord's Road, leading out of town; the others enter the crowded market and start shoving their way through the suddenly flabbergasted crowds.

Your heart sinks. This is definitely not good.

>[8] d
As you climb back down the crates, one of them wobbles and your foot slips. You tumble loudly to the cobblestones. Stupid! Clumsy! you mutter, scrambling to your feet.

From the street, you hear, "What was that? Check the alley!"

Two mercenaries rush in and spot you immediately. They approach warily, their arms spread wide.

You're in trouble now...

>[9] z
Time passes.

>[10] z
Time passes.

>[11] z
Time passes.

A rock-hard fist closes around your upper arm. "Gotcha!" the mercenary sneers. The other one starts hollering for his companions.

>[12] steal knife
Desperately, you start grabbing and pulling at the mercenary's clothes, hoping to get free by getting in close. Your hand grasps something smooth and heavy on the mercenary's back. With a jerk, it pulls free.

"Damn, he's got my knife!" shouts the mercenary, and his grip on you momentarily loosens. You're free!.

>[13] se
You dash away into the crowd, weaving between strolling customers and pushing your way through the thickest knots of people. The mercenaries pound after you, yelling and shoving people out of their way, but they're too big and too slow, and you quickly manage to lose them.

Grubber's Market, Northwest Junction
This is the northwest corner of Grubber's Market. You can skirt around the edge of the market to the northeast or south, or head into the center of the market to the southeast. A wide, paved road leads north, towards Lord's Keep. You can also duck back into the alley to the northwest.

>[14] test market
(Testing.)

>[15] s

Herb Stall
The herb stall is usually a quieter place. Customers like to browse, poke their noses into the various jars and pouches, and judge the potency of a potential purchase at their leisure. You've never understood the fascination, yourself. More interesting stalls are to the south, and the market opens out a little to the north.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

>[16] s

Leather Shop
You pause here for a few deep breaths - you've always enjoyed the smell around the leather merchant's stall. More stalls lie to the north and southeast.

>[17] se

Weapons Stall
The weaponsmith's wares hang from wooden racks along the sides of this stall, a grim picket fence of down-hanging blades. You can find less intimidating stalls to the east and northwest.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

>[18] e

Exotic Gems Stall
The shelves of this stall are lined with black velvet cloth, across which are spread dozens of jewels in exotic colors and cuts, all glittering in the dusty sunlight. Other stalls lie to the west and northeast.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

Suddenly you hear a commotion from the back of the stall: the crash of a display case hitting the ground; shouts and curses from the stall keeper; and a horrific, gibbering shriek.

"Come back here, you flea-bitten thief!" yells the stall keeper, and for a panicked moment you think he means you. Then you see something small and gray dart up to the roof of the stall... it's just a forest monkey, probably someone's pet running loose. And it's clutching one of the stall keeper's necklaces in its tiny black fist.

The monkey turns and screeches back at the stall keeper, dodges a clumsily thrown dirt clod, and scampers up the nearby support pole.

>[19] w

Weapons Stall
The weaponsmith's wares hang from wooden racks along the sides of this stall, a grim picket fence of down-hanging blades. You can find less intimidating stalls to the east and northwest.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

>[20] sell knife
The stallkeeper takes the weapon from you and turns it over in his large, scarred hands, frowning. He looks at you, then he looks over at one of the mercenaries swaggering around at the far end of the market, bullying the other market-goers and scaring away business. Then he smirks.

"Here you go," he says, reaching into his apron pocket and tossing you a coin. "Spend it wisely."

>[21] nw

Leather Shop
You pause here for a few deep breaths - you've always enjoyed the smell around the leather merchant's stall. More stalls lie to the north and southeast.

>[22] buy belt
The stallkeeper barely glances at the coin before dropping it into his purse. "Sure, sure," he mutters, handing you a belt. "Here you go. Now beat it, all right?"

>[23] n

>[25] ne

Fruit Stall
Bins heaped high with bright-colored fruit lend a pleasant fragrance to this end of the market (though by afternoon it will have become a cloying reek that attracts more flies than customers). Aisles between the stalls lead southwest and southeast.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

>[26] trade apple for banana
The stallkeeper takes the apple and looks it over critically, then grunts. "A fair trade," he mutters, "...barely." He hands you the banana - more eager to get rid of you quickly, you suspect, than worried about a few pennies' profit.

Grubber's Market, Northwest Junction
This is the northwest corner of Grubber's Market. You can skirt around the edge of the market to the northeast or south, or head into the center of the market to the southeast. A wide, paved road leads north, towards Lord's Keep. You can also duck back into the alley to the northwest.

>[28] se

Rope Dealer
One thing you can say about the rope stall: you'll never spend a moment wondering what's for sale. Rope and lots of it, thick and thin, knotted or loose, in heaps and in coils, stacked on the floor or hanging from pegs. More stalls are to the northeast and southeast, and the market opens out a bit to the northwest.

Rising up behind the stall is a tall wooden post.

>[29] se

Outside Silk Tent
Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or continue on to other stalls to the northeast or northwest.

Rising up behind the stall is a tall wooden post.

>[30] n

Inside Silk Tent
The fabric walls lend a bit of privacy and quiet from the crowds outside (in addition to keeping dust off the merchandise). Beautiful silk garments hang from racks on either side. The main market lies to the south. A narrow gap in the back leads behind the tent.

"Hello, Jack," says Teisha. "Change your mind about that cloak?" Then she gets a look at your face and frowns. "Something the matter, sweetie? You look spooked."

>[31] n
Teisha holds the back flap back as you duck through. "Be careful now..." she says, "...
Jacqueline."

Behind the Silk Tent
This is an empty space formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent, meeting at the corners to form a cramped little square. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post, which rises up a good twenty feet from here. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.

>[32] u
You're totally hidden back here, so there's no one to stop you from climbing. By the time you're high enough for people to see you, you're also high enough that no one will notice anyway; no one ever bothers to look up in the Grubber's Market. After a minute or so of grunting and sweating, you reach the top.

Top of Center Post
Perched atop the high central post, you can look out over the whole market square. To the north, Lord's Road heads out of the city towards Lord's Keep. Commerce Street and the rest of the city beckon to the east. In every other direction the city is surrounded by rolling meadows and farmlands.

Attached to the top of the post are four thick, braided anchor cables, stretching away in the four cardinal directions. Their other ends are tied to four smaller support posts around the perimeter of the market, far below.

Balancing on one of the wires is that monkey. The monkey sniffs the air excitedly as you come closer, and emits a hopeful chirp.

The monkey stares hungrily at your banana.

>[33] give banana to monkey
You hold out the banana and wiggle it enticingly. "Here, monkey. C'mon, little monkey," you whisper, trying to ignore how stupid it sounds.

The monkey creeps closer, eyes locked on the yellow fruit. It's only about a foot away from your out-stretched hand now. It's little face contorts into bizarre expressions as it wrestles with the conflicting desires to grab the tasty treat, hold onto the shiny trinket, and stay out of your reach, all at the same time.

Suddenly the monkey lunges. You make with your free hand. The monkey grabs the banana just as your fingers hook around the necklace's chain. The monkey screams and jumps six feet straight up, lands on your head, and scampers off down the wire behind you. Your heart leaps into your throat as you lose your balance on top of the pole. You totter, pinwheel your arms... and stay on.

You're breathing hard, but you're safe. And you have the necklace.

Somewhere far below you, a stallkeeper is cursing and wiping smushed banana off his face.

>[34] d
You take a deep breath, lower yourself carefully until you're hugging the side of the pole, and let yourself slide down.

Teisha looks up. "Hi Jack. Hanging in there?"

>[36] trade necklace for cloak
(the silk garments)
Teisha's eyebrow shoots up when you show her the necklace, but she manages to hide her excitement with the coolness of a professional haggler. "Not top quality," she mutters, "but very nice..." She gives you a look. "Now, tell me the truth, Jack, you didn't just steal this from somewhere, did you?"

You shake your head proudly. It's not exactly a lie.

"All right." The necklace disappears into one of Teisha's pockets. "Let's see..." she starts searching through the clothes on the racks, looking for something in your size. "This should fit. I think it suits you, too." She holds out a girl's cloak, simple but elegant. "What do you think?"

It's beautiful. Eagerly you nod your agreement.

Teisha smiles. "Then it's yours."

>[37] n
"Careful out there," calls Teisha as you duck through the back again.

Attached to the top of the post are four thick, braided anchor cables, stretching away in the four cardinal directions. Their other ends are tied to four smaller support posts around the perimeter of the market, far below.

>[39] slide down north cable with belt
You wrap one end of the belt around your hand and sling the supple leather over the anchor cable. Then, after giving it one more good yank to test your grip, you push off.

The wind is exhilarating as you zip down the line to the ground below. Several people look up, including the mercenaries. Shouts ring out and fingers point. You hit the support post with your feet, let go of the belt, and drop to the ground next to the fruit stall, slightly breathless.

Not everyone saw where you landed - most people are still staring up at the wires. You've only got a few moments while the guards' chins are still in the air. Better make the most of them.

Fruit Stall
Bins heaped high with bright-colored fruit lend a pleasant fragrance to this end of the market (though by afternoon it will have become a cloying reek that attracts more flies than customers). Aisles between the stalls lead southwest and southeast.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

>[40] wear green cloak
(first taking off the gray cloak)
You take off the gray cloak.

You slip the cloak around your shoulders, fastening it just under your neck in the feminine style and drawing the edges together to hide your clothes. If you took your cap off, you'd look just like a young girl, albeit one with a very uneven haircut.

>[41] remove hat
You take off the hat.

>[42] se

Miscellaneous Food
Baskets bristling with loaves of bread; yellow pyramids of cheese; spiced jerky hanging in bundles overhead - a typical grocer's stall. You can continue along the market's outer ring to the northwest or south.

>[43] s

Eastern Junction
You're near the eastern edge of Grubber's Market. Commerce Street lies to the east. You can travel along the outer ring of stalls to the north or south, or head towards the market's central hub to the west.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

>[44] e
You keep your head down and walk at a steady pace - not too fast, not too slow. The mercenaries posted at the market's entrance aren't paying attention: they're looking over your head at the market, trying to see what the big commotion is under the awnings.

You hold your breath as you walk past, close enough to touch one of them. No one stops you. Five more steps...four...three...

And then you are past them, out of Grubber's Market and into Commerce Street and the inner city.

Grubber's Market Eastern Edge
Grubber's market is to the west, along with the searching mercenaries. Commerce Street beckons to the east.

A red-faced shopper pauses to inspect the merchandise, then moves on.

>[45] e
You let out a long, shaky breath. You're safe now. Commerce Street is home to a slightly more upscale class of merchant, and business here is not quite as frantic as in Grubber's Market. Transactions tend to be calmer, more deliberate, and involve significantly more money. The Lord's Guard will be far less tolerant of a pack of armed bullies menacing the citizens of the upper class, so it's unlikely that the mercenaries will follow you here. And even if they did, there are too many streets and side alleys for them to block off your escape.

Now it's time to pause, catch your breath, and try to figure out why they were after you in the first place.

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs from Grubber's Market, to the west, to Lord's Market to the east. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east.

>[46] test meeting

>[47] wear grey cloak
(first taking off the green silk cloak)
You take off the green silk cloak.

You put on the gray cloak.

>[48] wear hat
You pull the cap down over your head and stuff your hair up into it.

>[49] e

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before winding up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

>[50] e
Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the discreet, tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south.

As you are standing there getting your bearings, the door to the moneylender's shop suddenly slams open. A tall, dark-cloaked figure storms out, shouting over his shoulder, "...regret refusing my business! I know import-OOF!" -and before you have a chance to react, he crashes into you. You both hit the cobbles in a tangle of limbs. Muttering apologies, you try to disentangle yourself, but the man is on his feet in an instant, dragging you up by your elbow. "Why you insolent little cutpurse-"

 A woman standing next to him places her hand on his shoulder. "Calm yourself, Fossville," she says. Only her chin and a few curls of long, golden hair are visible beneath the shadow of her hood, but the woman's voice is cool and commanding. "She's only a foolish little girl. You've already terrified her."

 The man - you realize now that he must be Baron Fossville, Lord of the city since the old Duke died, and one of the most powerful nobles in Toresal - eyes you suspiciously. Even flustered, his sharp features are intense, handsome, and dangerously intelligent. His lips twitch slightly beneath his trim moustache. Finally, he releases you.

 "Off with you then, urchin," he growls, flicking his fingers as though he had just touched something filthy. "Sell your paper flowers elsewhere, and learn to stay out from under the feet of your betters." Fossville strides off towards Commerce Street, followed closely by his hooded companion. As she brushes past you, you can hear her talking in a low voice, "...have the money you need, but we must be subtle about it. The Queen can not appear to play favorites..."

 And then they are gone.

>[51] s

Back Alley
A little-known shortcut between Lord's Market and the less affluent neighborhoods of the city's south end. A narrow street to the southwest leads to Maiden House, or you can return to the market square to the north.

At the end of the alley, a group of young urchins - none older than their eighth year - are clustered around something. As you draw closer, you see Bobby crouched in the midst of them. He's holding his arm out, his fist loosely clenched in front of a dirty-cheeked child of six.

"Go on," says Bobby. "Go on, take a look."

The little boy, his eyes wide and solid, reaches out and pries Bobby's fingers open. His hand is empty. The little boy looks dismayed.

"Ah, but what's this?" asks Bobby. And he reaches forward and draws a copper coin from behind the boy's grimy ear. A collective gasp, then squeals of delight from the rest of the children, and the little boy's eyes look ready to fall out of his head.

Bobby presses the coin into the little boy's hand, then passes out more coins to the others. "Here," he says, "keep it safe in your pocket. Spend it on bread, not candy." The children take their prizes and scatter.

Bobby stands and stretches, then he sees you. The corner of his mouth goes up in that lop-sided grin you know so well. "'Lo, Jack," he says. "What's happening?"

>[52] z
Time passes.

Bobby smirks at you in that way he has, that makes you want to smile and blush and run and hide, all at the same time.

>[53] z
Time passes.

Bobby whistles a few notes of some popular mummer's tune.

>[54] z
Time passes.

"Hey listen," says Bobby, "So I've been looking for you, right? I found this new place, big secret, extra tricky. I was thinking of doing a bit of exploring there later tonight. You want to come with?" He smiles that knowing half-smile of his, the one that always means he's about to suggest something that will be very fun, or land you both in a pile of trouble, or - the usual case - both.

What, you're going to say no? Heart thumping a bit harder than you'd like it to, you give an enthusiastic nod.

"Good fellow," says Bobby. "Now, you don't want the Maidens worrying about you, so head on home for now. Once it gets dark, sneak back out and meet me in the Grubber's Market. Right? Good. See you later, Jack." He claps his hand on your shoulder, then turns and strides all grace and overconfidence, out of the alley.

>[55] sw

Entrance to Maiden House
The alley dead-ends in a small courtyard surrounded by old, run-down buildings.

A battered wooden door provides entrance into the southern building.

>[56] s
You slip quietly through the front door, into the familiar smells of cooking grease and laundry soap; the familiar sight of shabby, warped floorboards lit by dim, flickering tallow lamps. It's nothing fancy, but it's home, and you're familiar enough with the plight of most of Toresal's orphans to know that you're lucky to have it.

Hallway
The main hallway runs north-south through the center of Maiden House, with several doors leading to rooms on either side. To the southeast and southwest are the laundry and privy, respectively; to the northeast lies the kitchen; and to the northwest is the dormitory where you and the other orphans sleep.

The front door is open.

You can also see Widow Theresa here.

>[57] se

Laundry
The air in here is filled with steam and the sharp stink of lye soap. Moisture trickles down the walls, and puddles of water splash underfoot. The main hallway lies northwest.

Widow Shannon is bent over the big washtub in the corner, scrubbing out the toddlers' nappies.

You can also see Widow Theresa here.

Widow Theresa strides over to the front door and slams it shut. "The evening churchbells are ringing, Jacqueline," she tells you, her mouth set in a grim little line. "Well past the time when any respectable young lady should be out on the streets." She locks the door with a long brass key that she wears on a ribbon around her neck.

>[59] sw

Privy
Not much more than a narrow closet, with a hole in the floor and a bench over it. At least it's more private than an alley.

A narrow window over the bench provides some ventilation.

>[60] climb through window
You sneak a furtive glance back at the hallway, then step up onto the bench. It wobbles under your feet, and you grab the window sill to steady yourself.

Then, holding your breath to keep from making a sound, you pull yourself up and through. The window is at ground level outside, and you wriggle out onto the slick cobblestones.

You're free! Of course, the widows will find out you're gone soon enough - Maiden House is not a very big place, after all. But you've snuck out before, and they know you can take care of yourself. At worst, you'll pull extra laundry duty for a few days.

Behind Maiden House
This tiny spur of an alleyway runs between the back of Maiden House and the high stone wall surrounding the park. You can make your way around to the Maiden House Entrance to the northeast.

A narrow window over the bench provides some ventilation.

>[63] n

Lord's Market
At night, lanterns hung from ornate posts light the empty square of Lord's Market. Their warm yellow glow seems to make the shadows in the alleys that much darker.

>[64] w

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before winding up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

>[65] w

Commerce Street
Commerce Street at night is eerily quiet and empty. Your footsteps seem to echo on the cobbles as you walk past the shuttered shopfronts.

>[66] w

Grubber's Market
At night, the normally crowded marketplace is an empty maze of shadows, abandoned stalls and rolled-up canvas. The Lord's Road lies north, your little alley lies northwest, and Commerce Street lies back east.

Bobby is standing in the middle of Grubber's Market, under the shadow of the center pole. When he sees you he jogs over quietly and puts his hand on your arm.

"Had a spot of trouble getting away from the Maidens, eh, Jack?" he whispers.

"Yeah, some," you shrug. Not really, but maybe Bobby will be impressed if he thinks you made a daring escape.

Bobby smiles. "Well, you made it. Nice and tricky. Now come with me, keep your hood up, your head down, and land your feet soft. We're going to the Lord's Wood. That place I wanted to show you is there. You game?" He points north, to the road leading out of the city.

>[67] test adventure
(Testing.)

>[68] n
Bobby saunters along next to you.

Lord's Road
The wide and well-paved Lord's Road runs from Toresal's North Market Gate straight north to Lord's Keep, a mile or so from the city. To the east are rolling pastures; to the west, broken ground and scrub.

>[69] e
Bobby follows close behind you.

Pasture
This wide, open field is used by the city for tourneys and other holiday events, or by cattle-sellers driving their livestock to market. Tonight it is empty except for the occasional cow pie. To the north you can see the dark, rough edge of a forest.

You feel nervous and exposed out here in all this empty space; you're more used to the narrow alleys and enclosing walls of the city. The urge to hunch over and make yourself small is near-irresistable.

Bobby, meanwhile, strides out into the middle of the moonlit field, standing straight and swinging his arms wide. "Fresh air, Jack!" he calls out, laughing. "Enjoy it! Take a deep breath!"

>[70] take a deep breath
Mostly you smell cow pies.

"We should head that way," Bobby says, pointing north.

>[71] n
Bobby hurries ahead to scout the way, then waits for you to catch up.

Stream
A small stream bubbles out of the woods and cuts through the pasture's north end. The edge of the forest lies to the north, just across the water. The city is far away to the south.

>[72] n
Bobby hops nimbly across, bouncing from rock to rock as though he were playing a game of "circles and stones" back in the city. He doesn't get so much as the hem of his cloak damp. When he gets to the opposite bank, he turns and beckons you to follow.

 The first couple of rocks are easy enough, but the third one wobbles when you put your weight on it. You end up pinwheeling your arms desperately, contorting yourself in every direction to avoid a tumble and a thorough soaking. Finally, with arms outstretched and lower lip clamped between your teeth, you pick your way across the remainder of the stream with all the grace of a drunkard on a greased tightrope. By the time you reach the opposite shore, Bobby is nearly doubled over with silent laughter. He claps you on the back. "You're a good sport, Jack," he says. "C'mon, we're nearly there."

Small Woods
You are in the woodlands just southeast of Lord's Keep, following the game trails that wind their way through strands of pale birch and black spruce. There is just enough moonlight trickling through the upper branches to see your way by. A bubbling stream flows out of the forest to the south, into an open pasture.

>[73] n
Bobby saunters along next to you.

Clearing
The woods open out here in a small, moonlit clearing. The ruins of an old pavilion lie here, pale pavestones poking up like bones from the grass.

In the center of the clearing stands a crumbling fountain, topped by a cracked statue of Brigid pouring an urn.

"Here we are." Bobby jumps up into the bowl of the fountain, dried leaves crackling beneath his boots. Then he reaches around the statue of Brigid as though trying to embrace her. His hands fumble at something on the underside of the urn.

Suddenly there is a deep, solid thunk, and a scraping sound. And part of the base of the statue moves.

Bobby hops down and pushes against the statue's base. A rectangle of stone about two feet square swings inward on protesting hinges. The space behind it is utterly black, and a cold, draft of damp-smelling air rises out of it.

"It runs all the way to Lord's Keep," says Bobby as he brushes off his hands. "I don't think anyone knows about it. Maybe Lord Toresal did, but now that he's dead it's basically unknown. It's not been used for decades, I'd guess. Well anyway, until now, that is."

He holds out his hand. His lop-sided smile is absolutely charming. "After you, kind sir."

>[74] d
You grope your way down into the tunnel, carefully sliding your feet over steps you cannot see. Echoes fill the darkness: the scrape of your shoes on stone, the drip of water, your own loud breathing.

Behind you, you hear Bobby fumbling with something under his cloak; the click of stone on metal; and then a sickly orange glow spreads across the walls of the tunnel. Your own shadow wobbles hugely in front of you.

You turn around and see Bobby holding a torch. He grins at you. "Tricky, isn't it?"

Underneath The Fountain
The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.

You can see some steps here.

>[75] n
Ducking your head to avoid the low ceiling, you follow the tunnel for some distance.

Tunnel End
The tunnel ends here at a blank, stone wall.

Bobby steps past you and brushes his fingertips across the stonework, holding the torch close. Eventually he finds a loose brick and pulls it free, revealing a rough, rectangular hole.

You wonder how many times Bobby has been down here. He exudes such easy confidence as he reaches into the hole, as though he has done this many times before.

There is a click. Bobby looks over his shoulder at you and winks. And then the wall swings away, revealing shadowed spaces beyond.

>[76] n
Bobby sticks close to you.

Chapel
The chapel of the Goddesses is a spacious, octagonal room, empty of furniture. The wood-paneled walls glow warmly, reflecting the light from dozens of devotional candles; the high ceiling disappears in the shadows overhead. A corridor leads southwest, and a secret passage in the south wall leads into subterranean gloom.

>[77] sw
Bobby sticks close to you.

Lower Bailey
A thick wedge of shadow falls across the courtyard at the base of the Keep's outer wall, providing a relatively safe place to hide. The rest of the courtyard is flooded with moonlight, and bored-looking guards stroll back and forth over the gravel.

Steep stone steps climb up to the top of the wall. You could make a dash up them, if you timed it right.

>[78] u
Bobby sticks close to you.

Upper Bailey
At the top of the wall you can lean out over the parapets and take in all the lands surrounding Toresal. It's a nice view, but torches set every few yards along the wall make this a dangerous spot to linger in. Stairs lead down into the courtyard below, and a dark archway opens to the north.

>[79] n
Guardhouse
A narrow antechamber, with an open archway to the south and an iron-reinforced door to the north. Arrow slits to either side lend the door an important and dangerous air.

Bobby creeps forward and presses himself against the wall next to one of the arrow slits. He hunches closer, peering around the slit's edge. Then he looks up at you and smiles. He points at you, points at the arrow slit, then taps his ear. Listen, he's telling you.

>[80] listen at slit
You can hear several voices coming from the room on the other side of the arrow slit - guards relaxing on break, probably.

"...and I says, I don't care who hired you, people are tryin to do honest business here, and you're steppin on toes. Take yer men and hit the road, or else you can continue searchin for yer urchin boy in the city jail. And this tough fellow, him so hard with his sword and his scars and all, he just starts to cry, blubberin like a frightened scullery maid!"

"Haw! Yer lyin, so you are!"

"Goddesses witness, tis the truth! I could hardly credit it meself, and I weren't that impressed with the man to begin with. Go on, I says, and gave him a boot to the arse to send him on his way."

There is general laughter. You glance at Bobby, but he motions you to keep listening.

>[81] listen to slit
"You seen tomorrow's detail yet?"

"Yeah, dress-up duty. Polishing helmets so we can look all pretty for the lords and ladies coming down to Baron Fussypants" ball."

"Not just lords and ladies, I heard. Word has it the Queen herself is on the guest list, and she's expected to appear."

"Oh, pull the other one."

"Goddesses witness it. They say she's comin down with her daughter in tow, that's why Fossville's hosting the ball in the first place. He's trying to get in the Queen's good graces, he wants to marry the girl."

"What, the Queen?"

"No, you dim. He wants to marry the Princess. Our Lord Fussypants is trying to position himself for the throne."

"Well, he's welcome to it, long as I'm paid at week's end. Of course, I'm not looking forward to spending a night standing at attention for a horde of fancy, feathered fops to goggle and gaggle at, but I guess it's better than latrine duty..."

Bobby pulls you away. He's grinning, his eyes wide and his eyebrows cocked. Isn't it great? 

But you're too nervous to care. There are who knows how many men of the Lord's Guard right on the other side of that door. Someone could walk out at any second. You grab Bobby's arm and give it a firm yank - It's time to go.

A corridor leads southwest, and a secret passage in the south wall leads into subterranean gloom.

>[85] s
Tunnel End
The wall at the north end of the tunnel has swung open, revealing a secret entrance to the castle.

Bobby reaches back and pulls the secret door shut, carefully easing it the last few inches so that it doesn't slam. He puts the loose brick back in its place, just as before, and tugs his torch free of the bracket where he'd left it.

We're out, you realize with a sense of overwhelming relief. We made it. It's like we were never here. 

"Some adventure, eh, Jack?" laughs Bobby. His voice is disturbingly loud after the long minutes of terrified silence in the keep. "Eavesdropping on the Lord's own guardsmen! That's a story that'll have the little ones wide-eyed at the Maiden House, eh?" He claps you on the back, and you manage a smile. It was fun, and you want Bobby to think you had fun, but it will be a while before you feel up to something that dangerous again.

>[86] s
Stealthily, you creep back up the long tunnel.

Underneath The Fountain
The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.

You can see some steps here.

>[87] u
"I'll go first," whispers Bobby, "to make sure the coast is clear." He dunks his torch in a puddle of mud and bounds lightly up the steps. For a moment you can see him silhouetted against the starlight; then he moves away from the opening and disappears from view.

You wait for ten heartbeats. Behind you, you hear the distant plip of dripping moisture, far back in the dark tunnel. Above you, you can hear crickets chirping in the nearby forest. Ten more heartbeats. "Bobby?" you call out in a hoarse whisper. Maybe he can't hear you, but you're too nervous to raise your voice. "Bobby? Are you up there?"

There is no answer.

>[88] u
You crawl out of the hole in the base of the statue, into the dirt and leaves littering the bottom of the fountain. Apart from your scrabbling, it's quiet out here - very quiet. Even the crickets have stopped, you realize. Finally, you get to your feet and look around.

 Bobby is lying face-down in the grass, just a few yards away. One of the mercenaries from Grubber's Market is kneeling with his knee in the small of Bobby's back, binding his wrists together with twine. Standing around the outside of the fountain are several more mercenaries, looking relaxed and smug. Some of them are chuckling to themselves.

 A gaunt man wearing red robes walks up to you. His mouth is half-hidden by long, drooping, black moustaches, but underneath them he is smiling like a snake. "Well now, young...sir? Or is it 'miss'? So much confusion, all to catch one little mouse. You led us a merry chase this morning, little mouse, but I think you will not scurry away from us again."

Leaves crunch behind you. You jump for it, but too slow - rough hands haul you back, and a sack of coarse, black cloth is pulled over your head.

"Good night, little mouse."

Something hard and heavy strikes the back of your head, and the night turns black as pitch.


Please press SPACE to continue.

Slowly the world comes back to you. You feel something cold and hard against your cheek; something gritty and scratchy under your hand. You hear footsteps on stone, muttering voices that fade in and out. Someone laughs, a raw, cruel sound. A loud squeak, and an echoing, metallic crash. The footsteps fade away.

You open your eyes. It's still dark.

No, it's just dim. Dim light trickles in from somewhere above you.

You sit up, and a tender spot on the back of your head throbs. Red and purple splotches bloom in front of your eyes, then fade away. After a moment or two, your head clears, and you can see where you are.

Holding Cell
A dank, cramped, foul-smelling cell. A pair of ragged burlap blankets and a few lumps of filthy straw litter the floor. The barred door is to the north.

A hulking shape squats in the corner, staring at you with bloodshot eyes.

>[89] test jail
(Testing.)

>[90] z
Time passes.

>[91] z
Time passes.

Suddenly you hear a voice whisper your name. "Jack..." 

At first you think it's the creepy guy in the corner, but he hasn't moved. You're still staring at him when the whisper comes again, louder this time: "Jack..." 

It's coming from somewhere outside the cell. You rush up and press your face against the viewing window, but you can't see anything out there except an empty room. "Bobby?" you call, trying to keep the fear out of your voice. "Bobby, is that you? I'm locked in here, Bobby, help me!"

The voice chuckles, then coughs weakly. "I'm in the cell next to yours, Jack. I'm locked in, too. Sorry."

Your heart sinks a little at that, but at least being trapped in a cell with Bobby nearby is a little bit better than being trapped in a cell with no one around to help you... right?

>[92] z
Time passes.

"Jack, listen," Bobby says. His voice is ragged and hoarse; you're worried that the mercenaries might have hurt him badly. "I'm going to get us out of this mess, don't worry. But in case I'm not able to meet up with you after, you need to listen carefully."

In case you're not able to meet up with me? You wonder, dismayed. What does that mean? You start to protest, but Bobby cuts you off.

"Jack, listen to me. Go to Fossville's estate in the city. Use the rooftops; there's an alley next to the bakery where you can climb up."

"You want me to break into Baron Fossville's house?" you whisper back, incredulously. "Bobby, I don't understand-"

"He has secrets," Bobby goes on, "that you need to know. Secrets about your father."

You pause, stunned.

>[93] z
Time passes.

"Look for a letter-" says Bobby, but he is cut off by a door slamming open elsewhere in the room. Guards move past your cell door; one of them slams a wooden cudgel against the bars right in front of your face, and you stagger back. "Bobby?" you cry, "Bobby? What's happening? What letter?"

A metallic rattling, the squeak of hinges. Several meaty thuds, mixed with grunts and cries of pain. The guards reappear, this time dragging Bobby with them. He looks up as he passes the viewing window, and you get a brief glimpse of his face - bruised, bloody, but still smiling. You'd swear he was trying to wink at you, except that his eye is swollen shut.

"Fossville, Jack!" he yells as they bundle him off. "The rooftops! Look for the letter!"

Somewhere a door slams one final time... and then everything is silent.

>[94] z
Time passes.

>[95] z
Time passes.

"Well," says a thick, rough voice behind you. The shadowy man in the corner puts his huge, thick-fingered hands on his knees and pushes himself up. "Now that the guards are busy takin care of him..." the man stretches, glances at you, and smiles. It is not a friendly smile.

"Name's Jacobs, by the way."

>[96] z
Time passes.

The man called Jacobs wanders over to the cell door. "My father'll have me out of here by tomorrow, of course," he says, "but I don't like to wait that long." He barely looks at you - in fact, you're not sure that he's talking to you at all. It's more like he's just muttering to himself. 

Jacobs bends over and digs something out of the side of his boot.

>[97] z
Time passes.

Jacobs stands up and thrusts his hand through the viewing window. He curses and strains to push his arm through, but the bars are too narrowly spaced - he can't reach out past his elbow. "Damn," he mutters, "didn't expect this..." His face reddens with effort. "C'mon... aaah! Dammit!" He jerks his hand back, rubbing his wrist.

"Well, you gonna help me, or not?" he asks, and holds out a short, stiff piece of wire, pinched between his thumb and forefinger.

>[98] z
Time passes.

"C'mon, now, take it," Jacobs growls. "Ain't got all day."

>[99] z
Time passes.

>[100] get wire
Gingerly, you pluck the wire from his thick, calloused fingers... and at that moment, he lunges.

Quick as a flash, his hands are around your waist. He picks you up as though you weighed no more than a sack of feathers, and hoists you around to the viewing window. His breath is close on your neck. His hands are huge, and feel strong enough to snap you in half. "You ever picked a lock, before, girl?" he asks.

You manage a nod. Bobby showed you a few tricks once, but you've never actually tried to pick a lock "for real" before.

"Good. This one should be easy, long as you can reach it."

>[101] unlock door with wire
You slip your arm through the bars and reach down for the lock. It's a stretch - Jacobs has to lift you higher and press your shoulder painfully against the bars - but soon you feel the metal of the lockplate, and your fingers find the tiny, sharp-edged hole in the middle.

You jam the end of the lockpick in and start wiggling it around. Almost immediately, you realize that this is not going to work. The angle is too awkward, and you can't see what you're doing, and you can't feel the tumblers the way Bobby showed you when you practiced on the front door of Maiden House...

Then you feel the wire bump against something inside the lock. You manage to lever the end of the wire under something and push... you feel it start to give... you push a little harder, and it starts to pivot... you push harder, and it starts to slip off the end of your pick...

And then there is a snap, and the pick jumps out of your fingers and tumbles to the ground outside the cell door.

Jacobs puts you down. He puts his hand on the door... and pushes it open.

"Well," he says, looking you over with a sly expression, "you are a valuable girl, after all."

>[102] n

Jailhouse
The Jailhouse is hardly more comfortable than the cells themselves; a crude, small room of unfinished stone, with a wooden bench and table for the guards. Cells are south, west, and north, and a door to the southeast leads out.

You can see a piece of wire here.

Jacobs arrives from the south.

>[103] get wire
Taken.

Jacobs pauses and turns to you. "I heard what your friend in the other cell said, before they dragged him out," he says. "Sounds like Fossville's taken quite an interest in you, girl."

Again, you nod.

He seems to consider something. "You can come with me if you want," he says. "I'll take you somewhere safe."

A shaky, wheedling voice from the north cell calls out: "Don't you listen to him, girl! That's Jacobs the Elder's son; he'd as soon sell you to the slavers as help you."

"Shut up, you!" yells Jacobs, pounding on the cell door in a sudden rage.

>[104] unlock north door with wire
"Fine, then," Jacobs snarls, "find your own way past the guards, whelp." He turns on his heel and stalks out, leaving you alone with the other prisoners.

Picking a lock is much easier when you're standing on the ground and can see what you're doing. Twenty seconds, and you have the cell door open.

"Oh, thank you, girl, thank you," snivels the red-faced man as he stumbles out of his cell. "You did well to stay away from that Jacobs; his father is a thief and a murderer, and his father's son is no better. I am called Olmer, and this is my associate, Darrens." The skinny man standing behind him smiles and nods enthusiastically.

"And now," says Olmer, "let us make our escape - after you, dear lady."

>[105] se
Olmer leads you and nodding Darrens through the dim, torchlit halls, into an older part of the building where the floors are dusty, the walls crumbling with disuse. Eventually you find yourselves in a small, musty chamber, featureless except for a rusty grating on the floor.

Olmer squats down and pulls the grating free from the rotten masonry with surprising ease. The hole underneath is a couple of feet wide, enough for you to slip through with ease, and enough for Olmer if he sucks in his gut. "The anchors rusted away ages ago," he explains. "No one ever comes back here to check on it, so no one's ever bothered to fix it." Darrens, standing nearby, nods knowingly.

"How did you know about it?" you ask.

"Oh, everyone knows about it," Olmer says airily, although you wonder exactly who he means by everybody. "The trick is getting to it. The jailers are not usually kind enough to leave us a compassionate rescuer with a lockpick."

He sets the grating aside. "You go first, Darrens and I will follow."

Well, in for a penny, in for a pound. You sit down and dangle your feet over the edge of the hole. You can hear the sound of running water, and smell the sharp stink of sewage. You offer a quick prayer to Brigid - Please give me a chance to wash up before seeing Bobby again - take a deep breath, and drop down into darkness.

Sewer
The tunnels down here are made of ancient, unmortared brick, slimy with centuries of filth and mold. Branch tunnels split off in every direction.

Olmer drops down into the muck next to you, followed by Darrens. He must have picked up a lantern somewhere along the way through the jailhouse, for now he holds it high. The steady flame paints the brick in a warm, yellow glow. Outside the circle  of light, the tunnels are pitch black.

"Follow us close now, girl," whispers Olmer. His voice echoes off into the blackness. "These tunnels are twisty and befuddling, but we know the way." Darrens nods in solemn agreement.

Olmer stops and looks up, holding the lantern high. Up in the tunnel's ceiling, you can discern the outline of another grating set into the bricks.

"Darrens and I must pursue our business elsewhere," says Olmer, "but this should put you somewhere near your own neighborhood."

"It was very kind of you to set us free, young lady." He shakes your hand. (His hands are slimy with filth, but then so are yours.) "We've only our meagre gratitude with which to repay you, but we won't forget your generosity." Darrens nods vigorously and shakes as well.

Darrens boosts you up onto his shoulders. "The grating is loose, and easily shouldered aside," notes Olmer, and he's right - you have no trouble at all scrambling up out of the sewer hole and onto the street. The last you see of your friends is Darrens, smiling up at you from the tunnel, waving - and then Olmer's lantern moves on, and the tunnel is dark.

You're in an empty alleyway. From the look of the sky, it's early morning. After a couple of turns, you figure out where you are, and soon find yourself back in familiar environs.

Back Alley
A little-known shortcut between Lord's Market and the less affluent neighborhoods of the city's south end. A narrow street to the southwest leads to Maiden House, or you can return to the market square to the north.

>[119] unxyzzy
A hollow voice whispers "oorg."

>[121] n 

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the discreet, tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south.

>[122] w 

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before winding up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

>[123] w 

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs from Grubber's Market, to the west, to Lord's Market to the east. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east.

>[124] enter alley 
By sucking in your gut and turning sideways a bit, you manage to squeeze in between the two buildings.

Tiny Alleyway
Rough brick and mortar catches at your clothes. A few feet further in, and the walls draw too close together for even you to squeeze through. The main street is south.

>[125] climb walls 
Setting your shoulders against one wall and your feet against the other, you push yourself up. It's slow going: set one foot against the opposite wall, push, wriggle your shoulders up, repeat. The bakery occupies only the first floor of a three-story building, so you're quite a ways up by the time you reach the top. Finally, you grab hold of a rusted rain gutter and pull yourself onto the roof.

Bakery Rooftop
The rooftops are like a miniature mountain range up here, with peaks and valleys sloping away into the distance. Chimneys and stovepipes stand sentry like the keeps and towers of castles. Bobby has exclaimed the virtues of rooftop travel before, and finally you see what he was going on about. It feels like you could explore forever up here.

The gap between buildings is narrow enough here that you can climb down by wedging yourself between the closely-spaced walls.

>[126] e 
Trying not to look down, you hop nimbly across the gap to the next roof.

Butchers' Rooftop
The rooftops are like a miniature mountain range up here, with peaks and valleys sloping away into the distance. Chimneys and stovepipes stand sentry like the keeps and towers of castles. Bobby has exclaimed the virtues of rooftop travel before, and finally you see what he was going on about. It feels like you could explore forever up here.

Bobby has exclaimed the virtues of rooftop travel before, and finally you see what he was going on about. It feels like you could explore forever up here.

Across a wide gap to the east, you spy a balcony, and behind it trees waving in the breeze. That must be Fossville's rooftop garden, atop Black Gate Estate.

>[128] e 
You peer across the gap at the balcony, judging the distance. Then you look down at all the little people going about their business on East Commerce Street, far, far below.

It's a really far jump.

Still, this is where Bobby told you to go. A letter... secrets about your father, he said. The thought of facing Bobby when he gets out, after they beat him up so bad, and telling him you were too scared to do what he asked you to do...

You take a few steps back, run... and jump.

The railing slams into your chest, knocking the breath out of you. Your feet pedal madly in empty air. You wrap your arms around the railing, trying to grab on, but you're slipping...

Then your foot finds the edge of the balcony, and you push yourself up and over.

Roof of Black Gate Estate
Lord Fossville has transformed the rooftop of his estate into a landscaped folly. You're standing on a balcony, complete with ornate railing, that runs along the roof's western edge. To the northeast is a garden; to the southeast, a patio.

>[129] ne 

Rooftop Garden
The garden is an impressive piece of greenery in a city otherwise dominated by stone. Most of the flowers are not in bloom this late in the season, but there are autumn roses, and some nice hanging lilies climbing up a lattice. The patio is south, and the gallery lies to the southwest.

Over in the corner of the garden, against the eastern wall, is a small wooden shed.

Inside Shed
Gardening tools and burlap sacks of soil are stacked neatly in the corner, awaiting next spring. The door to the south leads back out to the garden, and through an archway in the east wall are stairs leading down into the house itself.

>[132] test blackgate

>[133] d 
Holding your breath, you tiptoe quietly down the stairs. A prickle runs up your spine; you are now an intruder. If the Baron catches you here, he'll have you tossed back into a jail cell - and that's the best case scenario. If what Bobby told you is true, and Fossville knows secrets about you that he's trying to hide, it's more likely he'll just slit your throat.

Have to move quickly, then - search the house, find this letter, and get out.

One of several landings along the main stair that winds up and down the back of Black Gate Estate. A hallway leads south.

You hear a door slam open somewhere on the floor below.

"Damn and blast it all!" someone yells. You recognize Baron Fossville's voice from running into him yesterday. "Servants! Bring me spiced wine - hot - and something to eat. No, you dim fool, down here - I'll be leaving again within an hour. Bring it now, damn your hide!"

The sounds of sudden, frantic activity drift up the stairs: footsteps, chairs scraping on wooden floors, glasses and dishes clinking.

Living Area
A wealthy bachelor's parlor, furnished with comfortable chairs and portraits of Fossville's illustrious ancestors hanging from the walls. A hallway leads north, and sliding doors lead south.

>[136] open doors 
The doors rattle slightly in their tracks -  not very loud, but enough to make you cringe.

>[137] s 

Master Bedroom
The bedroom, as you might have expected, is dominated by an enormous four-poster bed. Sliding doors lead north, back to the parlor, and another doorway leads south.

>[138] s 

Library
Tall bookshelves line all four walls, and a stately writing desk sits like an altar in the center of the dimly lit room. A doorway leads north to the bedroom.

>[139] search books 
The shelves reach almost to the ceiling, and each row sags beneath the weight of dozens of thick, dusty tomes. They look to be equally divided between the great classics of literature, and treatises on government, economics, and other scholarly topics.

 One shelf on the east wall catches your eye. The books on those rows seem newer than the rest, as though they were very recently acquired.

>[140] get book 
On a sudden impulse, you go to the shelf of newer books and pull out a volume on dynastic lineages in Miradan.

A folded sheet of parchment slips out from the pages and see-saws to the floor.

>[141] get letter 
Taken.

The parchment is thin and the ink faded, but the writing is still quite legible, a strong, graceful script that flows down the page.

 Your Royal Highness, it begins,

 It is with a sad but hopeful heart that I write to you, for I must reveal deeds that I am not proud of, and yet perhaps I may thereby put an end to an injustice that has gone on far too long.

 My lawful marriage was determined by political expediency rather than by the urgings of my own heart, as you well know. My wife was ever a dutiful companion, but never truly happy. I do not blame her. For my part, I did my best to ensure that she lived a lifestyle fitting for a Duchess of the nobility, and that she wanted for nothing save my love.

 Were this the full extent of my shame, I would have no need to write to you, for a loveless marriage is hardly a rare thing in our kingdom. However, it is to confess yet a further disgrace that I must pen this letter: I was not merely a cold but an unfaithful husband. I took a mistress, a woman on whom I bestowed all the tenderness I was unable to give my wife. And with this mistress, I had a child.

 I kept the child's existence a secret, as much to spare my wife the ignominy as to avoid the political complications that would otherwise have ensued.  From my private finances I established an orphanage here in the city, and paid a tutor from the Royal College to pose as one of the mistresses, to raise and educate the child properly. In secret I have sponsored this child for ten years.

 I feel it is past time for this secrecy to end. I have grown ill with a mysterious sickness these past months, and I fear that my life will soon come to a close. My wife was never able to provide me with a lawful heir, and yet I would not see my family name extinguished merely because I had not the courage to face up to my failings as a husband.

 Therefore it is my wish that the crown recognize this child, who bears no fault for the circumstances of her birth, as my sole and lawful beneficiary, to inherit my title and estate in full upon my death, or upon her sixteenth birthday should I die before she reaches the age of majority. I hereby, by my will and by royal law, and in full possession of my faculties, declare my heir:

           Jacqueline Toresal

 Signed and witnessed therewith,

 Lord William, Duke of Toresal


Your hand is trembling as you refold the letter. You tell yourself that it's a coincidence, just someone who happens to have the same first name as you - but in your heart you know it must be true.

 And yet... it poses so many more questions than it answers. The letter is addressed to the queen, and dated three years ago, just a few months before the Duke's death. Why was it never posted? And what is it doing in Baron Fossville's library?

 A noise from the bedroom startles you out of your puzzling. Now that you have what you came for, you need to get out of here - fast.

>[142] n 
You leave the library in a rush - and run smack into someone coming the other way.

It's all you can do to bite back a scream. You try to duck around the person and run, but he grabs your arm and pulls you back. "Little thief!" a voice hisses, "What are you doing here? What do you have?"

He turns you around to face him. He's an older man, wearing a servant's uniform - Fossville's butler.

Master Bedroom
The bedroom, as you might have expected, is dominated by an enormous four-poster bed. Sliding doors lead north, back to the parlor, and another doorway leads south.

>[143] z 
Time passes.

The butler drags you into the stairwell, then stops, his thin, bald head cocked, listening. From downstairs you hear more voices.

"...difficult is it to keep one half-witted street urchin locked in a cage for a single night?" That's the Baron again, you realize. "Because it is evidently far more difficult than I imagined. Perhaps I am not paying you enough for your heroic efforts so far?"

You hear a low, mumbled response.

"No, I daresay you don't," snaps the Baron, his voice acid with sarcasm. "I cannot express how galling it is that I still require your services; were it otherwise, I would sooner turn you all over to the Lord's Guards and let them deal with you like the useless curs you are."

The butler glances at you. You're beginning to suspect that Baron Fossville is not particularly well liked by his servants.

>[144] z 
Time passes.

"Gather your men at Lord's Market," says Fossville. "We'll deal with the spy first. Once that business is finished, we pay a visit to the Maidens. Though I suppose I should warn you - there may be several unarmed women. Let us hope they pose no greater challenge to your mercenaries than a fourteen-year-old girl."

The second voice mumbles another response.

"See that you do. I will be there shortly."

You hear footsteps, and then a heavy door slamming.

The butler holds his hand up, palm out. Wait.

>[145] z
Time passes.

Several agonizing minutes later, you hear the door slam a second time. The butler waits a few minutes more, then drags you downstairs. He takes you through the kitchens to a side door, and shoves you unceremoniously out onto the street.

"Go now, and don't come back," he says. "Next time, it won't be me that catches you. And if it is me, it'll go that much worse for you. A bit of advice girl," he adds, just before turning away, "keep yourself out of the Baron's way. He's not one to let a trifling of blood get in between him and his ambitions."

He slams the door.

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before winding up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

There seems to be some sort of spectacle going on in Lord's Market; pedestrians are crowding the streets, pressing east.

>[146] test hanging

>[147] e 

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is packed with people from every part of the city. Aristocrats, servants, merchants, and beggars, all rubbing shoulders and pressing in, craning to see something in the center of the square.

The crowd is surging around some sort of wooden structure erected in the center of the square.

>[148] x structure 
It's a raised platform, with some sort of scaffolding built over it, and a rope dangling from...

Suddenly your mouth goes dry. It's a gallows.

>[149] z 
Time passes.

A man steps up onto the wooden platform. By squeezing between two spectators and craning your neck, you can just make out that it is Baron Fossville addressing the crowd.

"Citizens of Toresal," he shouts, "as Lord of this City, it is my duty to administer justice within its gates, and punish those who transgress against the Queen's Law. More often than not, this duty is a heavy burden. Though I may wish to be lenient, consideration for the sanctity of the law and the safety of the Queen's subjects must always outweigh my softer instincts. Today, this burden weighs particularly upon me, for today I must administer the most stringent punishment allowed by the law."

 Soldiers prod a second man up onto the platform. The black bag covers his face, but you recognize him by the clothes he's wearing - it's Bobby!

>[150] z 
Time passes.

"This man before you stands accused of plotting high treason against the city of Toresal," shouts the Baron. "The evidence against him has been weighed, and he has been found guilty by the Honorable Magistrate Hester Rudup."

Fossville gestures to a third man standing on his other side, a gaunt man wearing crimson robes - the man who captured you last night at the fountain.

>[151] z
Time passes.

"Despite the grief it causes me, the penalty for this most heinous crime is clear." Fossville pauses; the crowd is hanging on his every word. "By the power invested in me and in accordance with the Queen's Law... I hereby sentence this man to hang by the neck until dead."

The Baron turns to one of his soldiers at the platform's base and nods his head.

Later, you cannot remember whether you really heard the clunk of the trapdoor falling open, the rope snapping taut, or whether you only imagined it. You remember screaming, clawing at the spectators in front of you, and being pushed back by rough, angry hands. You stumbled and fell onto the cobblestones; you never saw his body drop.

Eventually the crowd disperses. The soldiers have carted off the body, but left the gallows standing in the middle of the empty square.

Back Alley
A little-known shortcut between Lord's Market and the less affluent neighborhoods of the city's south end. A narrow street to the southwest leads to Maiden House, or you can return to the market square to the north.

>[154] sw 

Entrance to Maiden House
The alley dead-ends in a small courtyard surrounded by old, run-down buildings.

A battered wooden door provides entrance into the southern building.

>[155] s 

Hallway
The main hallway runs north-south through the center of Maiden House, with several doors leading to rooms on either side. To the southeast and southwest are the laundry and privy, respectively; to the northeast lies the kitchen; and to the northwest is the dormitory where you and the other orphans sleep.

The front door is open.

You can also see Widow Theresa here.

Suddenly Fiona is there, enfolding you in a crushing hug. "Oh Jacqueline," she says, "I saw what happened to Bobby. I'm so sorry, child..." Before you can think of how to respond, someone pounds on the front door. "Open in the name of Baron Fossville!" shouts a voice.

Fiona looks horrified. "It's the Baron!" she whispers. "I didn't think he'd come here so soon... quick, Jacqueline! Get to the laundry!"

>[156] se 
Laundry
The air in here is filled with steam and the sharp stink of lye soap. Moisture trickles down the walls, and puddles of water splash underfoot. The main hallway lies northwest.

Shannon is here, looking terrified. As you enter the room, she rushes over and pushes against one of the boards in the northern wall. It moves aside, revealing a narrow, dark opening.

"Quick, Jack," she whispers, "in here!"

The pounding continues.

>[157] n 
You squeeze in, and Shannon pulls the board back into place, shutting you into darkness.

Secret Closet
It is pitch black. The walls press close to either side; you can barely breathe.

The pounding continues. "Open this door, widow, before we break it down!"

>[158] z 
Time passes.

The pounding, which you can still hear, muffled, through the walls, suddenly stops. Many heavy footsteps tromp into the building, making the floorboards shudder beneath your feet.

"Where is she?" growls a rough voice. It's hard to tell from two rooms away, but it sounds very similar to the mercenary captain you heard yesterday morning, at the Grubber's Market.

>[159] z 
Time passes.

"Where is who, sir?" That must be Fiona.

"Don't play games with me, woman," snaps the first voice. "I've had my fill of it. The old Duke isn't here to protect you any more, and if one of my men were to be careless and injure someone, it would rest but lightly on the Baron's conscience, I can promise you that. Now, we know she came here after the hanging. Where is she?"

"I can tell you, good sir," says a third voice.

Bitter anger wells up in your throat, even as fear turns your stomach cold. That was Theresa!

>[160] z 
Time passes.

"This place is full of dark corners and hidey-holes," says Theresa, "but I think if you were to search carefully, you might uncover some dirty laundry."

Though you still can't see a thing, you can feel your cheeks burning. Theresa has always disliked you, but you never thought she would be so treacherous as to turn you over to the Baron's men.

"My thanks, madam," grunts the mercenary captain. "I'll make sure the Baron hears of your cooperation when we-"

"Jacqueline! Jacqueline, wait!" Several shouts. Running footsteps. What is going on?

>[161] z 
Time passes.

You hear heavy footsteps down the hall, running towards the laundry room... closer, closer... but then they suddenly turn away from the laundry room, towards... the privy?

"Jacqueline... oh, Goddesses." That's Shannon's voice.

"What is it?" yells the mercenary captain. "Where did the girl go?"

"She... she got away from me, Miss Fiona," wails Shannon. "I was trying to get her into the hiding place we got in the laundry room, like you said, but she slipped past me and wriggled out the privy window. You know how fast she can get through that window, Miss Fiona. She could be anywhere in the city by now. I'm so sorry, Miss Fiona, so sorry."

You can't help but grin. You've always thought of Shannon as being a trifle dim-witted. You'll have to revise your opinion of her.

>[162] z 
Time passes.

The mercenary captain utters a curse so foul that you actually wince. "Don't just stand there, you bleeding dims," he yells, "get out there and find her! You two, keep an eye on the alley in case she comes back. Go! Go! Find her or I'll have your hides!" The tromping footsteps run back up the hall, growing fainter this time, then vanishing altogether as they cross the threshold and exit Maiden House.

You let out a long, shaky breath.

>[163] z 
Time passes.

The door opens, and Fiona takes your hand as you stumble out of the stifling darkness.

"That was too close, child," she says, "and it won't be long before the Baron's men come back. You'll need to go quickly, out the privy window again." Although her manner is urgent, Fiona smiles a bit at that. "It's a route you're accustomed to, to be sure."

She presses a large brass key into your hand. "It's time you learned something of your past, Jacqueline. This is yours by right. It opens the way to your history. After you've seen what there is to see, go speak to Dame Sandler in Lord's Market. She will help you from there."

Hallway
The main hallway runs north-south through the center of Maiden House, with several doors leading to rooms on either side. To the southeast and southwest are the laundry and privy, respectively; to the northeast lies the kitchen; and to the northwest is the dormitory where you and the other orphans sleep.

The front door is closed.

You can also see Widow Theresa here.

>[165] sw 

Privy
Not much more than a narrow closet, with a hole in the floor and a bench over it. At least it's more private than an alley.

A narrow window over the bench provides some ventilation.

>[166] climb through window

Behind Maiden House
This tiny spur of an alleyway runs between the back of Maiden House and the high stone wall surrounding the park. You can make your way around to the Maiden House Entrance to the northeast.

A narrow window over the bench provides some ventilation.

You pull yourself through the window and once again clamber up into the alley. You can hear a commotion from the direction of Lord's Market; it looks as though the Baron's mercenaries are still out searching the streets for you, but they'll double back and put a watch on Maiden House soon enough.

 There is a scrabbling, grunting commotion behind you, and you turn to see Shannon trying to push her way through the window. Confused but not wanting to just stand there and watch her struggle, you give her a hand up.

 "Fiona thought I should maybe come with you," she says, after she's finished smoothing her skirts and catching her breath. "In case you needed any help."

>[167] test redgate

Shannon lays a hand on your elbow. "Wait, Jacqueline," she whispers. "The mercenaries will be watching the entrance. We'd best cut through the park. I'll help you climb the wall."

>[169] climb wall 
Shannon laces her fingers together and gives you a boost up to the top of the wall; then you reach down and help pull her up. You both drop down onto the grass on the other side, and then it's a quick sprint across the open space of the park. Fortunately, no one is about after the awful spectacle in Lord's Market, and you make it to the relative safety of East Commerce Street without anyone spotting you.

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before winding up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

Widow Shannon is here.

>[170] unlock red gate estate with key 
The lock is rusty and stiff from long disuse, but the key turns... and the door unlocks with a grinding clunk.

>[171] n 
You pause for one last glance over your shoulder at the streets of Toresal, so familiar from your years of skulking, scrounging, and sometimes even sleeping on them. Then you pass over the threshold, into Red Gate Estate.

Shannon follows silently.

Foyer
The entrance hall is large, high-ceilinged, and empty. Your footsteps echo on the marble floor. A doorway leads north to further rooms, and the street lies south.

The house is eerie in its stillness. The walls are bare; and all the furniture is draped in white sheets.

>[172] n 
Dining Room
The long table in the center of the hall is covered in sheets, as are the rows of chairs to either side. Doorways lead north and south.

"Lord Toresal was known for his hospitality," remarks Shannon. "He entertained guests here at his estate as often as he did at Lord's Keep. It's said he paid for his dinner parties from his own purse, rather than tax the city." She runs her hand along the sheet-draped dining table. "Your father was a good man, Jacqueline, and well loved by his subjects."

>[173] n 
Shannon follows you.

Kitchen
Without the usual clutter of pots and pans and utensils, the kitchen seems particularly barren. The firepit in the southwestern corner is cold and dark. The dining room lies south, and a wide staircase in the back of the room leads up to the second floor.

Bathroom
The walls of this small room are cold, bare marble. The only exit is to the north.

A pair of strange-looking devices protrudes from the south wall, hanging over the lip of a huge stone basin.

>[178] take a bath 
You plug the drain and begin filling the enormous tub with water.

 Shannon nods with approval but says nothing; somehow she seems to know what you were thinking. By the time you've gotten out of your sodden clothes and into the water, she's managed to scare up a cake of soap from somewhere. She smiles as she hands it to you.

 The water is scalding hot and exquisite. You rub the soap into your reddening skin, feeling it all wash away. Not just the dirt and the sweat, but everything: the fear and confusion of being hunted for two days straight; the moldy tunnel under Lord's Keep; the prison; the sewers. Even your grief and guilt over Bobby's death - it doesn't go away, not all of it, but it's not so heavy any more, not so sharp.

 You dry off with a sheet pulled from the furniture. As you reach for your old clothes, Shannon stops you and holds out a dress.

 "Where in the world-?" you ask.

 "The Duke's wife was a little lady, just about your size, really," Shannon says. "Not beautiful, but handsome in her way. And good taste in clothes." She puts the dress into your hands.

>[179] wear dress 
You slip the dress over your head, and Shannon helps you with the laces. The linen feels soft and light on your skin. She was right about the size, too; it's a just a little bit big around your chest; otherwise it fits fine.

 Finally, you look in the mirror. A complete stranger looks back at you: fair of skin, with dark eyes and high cheekbones. She wears fine clothes, and the tangles have been brushed out of her hair. She looks, you realize, quite pretty.

 This isn't Jack anymore, you think to yourself. This is Jacqueline.

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the discreet, tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south.

The crowd is surging around some gallows erected in the center of the square.

"Well," says Shannon, "I've seen you safely to Dame Sandler. I'd better get back to Maiden House; the Baron's men might get suspicious if I'm gone too long. Take care, Jacqueline." She hugs you tightly, sniffling a little, and then hurries off to the south.

>[189] e 

Sandler & Sons Jeweler
The inside of this store is tasteful but austerely decorated, perhaps to better draw the eye towards the glass display cases in the center of the room, and the king's ransom in jewelry contained therein. You can leave to the west.

Dame Sandler stands near the central display case. A small, dignified smile plays on her lips.

A guard stands discreetly near the back of the room.

Dame Sandler looks you over and smiles. She does not seem at all surprised by your change in dress.

"Lady Jacqueline," she says, inclining her head, "how nice to see you finally looking yourself, after all these years. Come, child, let me get a look at you." She takes your chin gently between two fingers and tilts your face back and forth. "Hmm. You've simply destroyed your hair, of course, but there's nothing to be done now. It will grow out eventually."

She catches your eye then, and laughs. "Oh, child, did you think I didn't know? More people have had their eye on you than you realize. We've been waiting for the Duke's daughter to finally make herself known, and now here you are."

>[190] z 
Time passes.

Her expression turns serious. "What you must realize, Jacqueline, is that you represent a threat to certain people with ambitions toward the throne. Oh, yes," she says, seeing your incredulous expression, "even though your birth was illegitimate, you have a credible claim. The laws of ascension in our land are clear: in the absence of a clear blood successor, the ruler is determined by the will of the common people.

"The Duke was very popular with the common people. Baron Fossville... is not."

>[191] z 
Time passes.

"The other thing you should realize is that there are also a number of people who are interested in seeing you succeed. Some of them may believe that you are the better candidate; more of them simply with to spite Fossville; all of them will expect you to be appropriately grateful for their aid should you actually succeed.

"But before you can enlist their aid," says Dame Sandler, "you must let it be known that you are in the game, and that you are a player worth backing. You must announce yourself. And to do that, you must attend Fossville's ball tonight."

You can barely catch your breath to respond. You? Attend a royal ball? This is all happening so fast...

Her voice softens a bit, and she puts a hand on your arm. "I realize this is a bit sudden and frightening, my dear, but you must accept it and act quickly. This will not simply go away; Fossville does not care whether you want the ascension; he will hunt you down regardless. So why not take him head-on? This is who you are, now. Enjoy it, play it to the hilt."

>[192] z 
Time passes.

"Of course, you cannot attend the ball looking like this," she says, her tone becoming brisk and businesslike again. "You will need a dress, some jewelry... and a weapon. It is unlikely that Fossville would try to kill you in front of a hundred guests, but you can never be too careful. This will require money, of course, but now that you have proof of your heritage, the Chorus Brothers should be willing to help you in that area.

"And just to reassure you of my own good intentions..." Dame Sandler unlocks the display case with a tiny silver key and lifts up the lid. She gestures to the sparkling jewels within. "This will get you started. Take any one you like, child. I'm one of those who would see you succeed; this is my gift to you."

>[193] z 
Time passes.

>[194] take jewel 
"A fine choice," says Dame Sandler. "Now hurry - Fossville's ball is tonight, and there's not much time left. See the moneylenders first, then get a suitable dress and a discreet blade. Pieter will go with you-"

 Pieter blinks. "What, to the ball?" he asks.

 "Yes, Pieter," Sandler says pointedly, "to the ball. Just do what you always do - keep your mouth shut and make sure no one harms the valuables, and you should be fine." She turns back to you and smiles. "On your way, now. And good luck, Lady Jacqueline."

Chorus Brothers'
The inside of this shop is dark - dark wood paneling on the walls; deep, wine-dark carpeting on the floor; even a pair of huge, leather armchairs over in one corner. The back half of the room is hidden behind a wall of reinforced wood, with a wide window cut through the center.

A moment after you enter, two faces suddenly appear at the window, each seeming to slide smoothly in from either side. They look at you with identical expressions of curiosity and a sort of mild, almost professional contempt.

"Good afternoon," says one.

"May we help you?" asks the other.

>[198] show letter to brothers 
The brothers both reach out, one with his right hand, the other with his left, and delicately take the letter from you. Their eyes flicker back and forth in unison as they scan the words. When they reach the end, four identical eyebrows shoot up. "How very..."

"...interesting. It would seem you are a personage of more..."

"...importance than first we assumed."

They hand the letter back to you, smiling, and ask in chorus, "How may we help you?"

>[199] ask brothers for a loan 
The two brothers lean forward eagerly, as though they've been waiting for you to ask.

"We would be delighted to extend to you..."

"...our most prestigious line of credit!"

Over the next few minutes they hand you dozens of sheets of paper covered in dense, tiny script, full of bizarre words like "amortization", "compound interest", and "escrow". Pieter tries to read some of it, with his brow furrowed up and his lips moving slightly; eventually he shakes his head and mutters, "Just sign all of them." You dutifully write your name where the brothers show you.

After it's all done, they sweep all the papers into a slim leather folder, and place a small sack of coins on the counter. "That's it?" complains Pieter, but when you tug open the drawstring, you see the sunlight gleam of gold.

"When you have secured your position, please remember us..." says one brother.

"...not merely as your creditors..."

"...but as your friends."

And both brothers smile in unison, revealing two sets of wide, white teeth.

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the discreet, tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south.

The crowd is surging around some gallows erected in the center of the square.

>[201] test clothier
(Testing.)

>[202] ne 
A small bell above the door tinkles as you enter, and a man comes rushing out of the store's back room with a measuring cord in his hands, held up as though ready to begin fitting you immediately. When he sees that you are a clean, respectable, and evidently well-to-do young lady, he practically squeals with delight, clapping his hands and plucking at the fabric of your clothes with soft, nimble fingers.

Royal Tunic
The walls are hung with tasteful curtains, and a deep, soft carpet covers the floor. Several clothier's dummies stand about the room, displaying gorgeous formal court apparel for both men and women. The street lies west.

The clothier hovers nearby, waiting to serve.

The clothier purses his lips and hums something indecipherable.

>[203] buy ballgown 
After several agonizing minutes of indecision, you point to the dress you  want.

The clothier flutters his hands and practically giggles, "Oh, a splendid choice! You'll look like a princess!" He dances around you, taking measurements with his cord and muttering numbers to himself as he goes. Then he takes the dress off its dummy and retreats with it into the back of his shop. "This will be just a moment," he calls over his shoulder.

You look at Pieter and shrug.

"Er, I'll wait outside," he says.

And afterwards, as you look at yourself in the full-length mirror while the clothier kneels at your feet, tugging, plucking, pinning, making adjustments, you realize that he was right - you do look like a princess.

Pieter blinks and does a double take as you step out onto the sidewalk in your new finery. "Wow," he stammers. "You look... different. I mean, you looked good before, er, with the other dress, I mean, but this is... wow." He blushes, then grins, then shakes his head. "Come on, Lady Toresal. We still have much to do."

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before winding up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

>[207] w 

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs from Grubber's Market, to the west, to Lord's Market to the east. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east.

>[208] ne 

Armory
The tangy smell of oiled steel is nearly overpowering in this small, windowless shop. All of the really interesting weapons - axes, flails, spiked gauntlets and the like - are high up on racks on the back wall, well behind the high counter. However, there is a display of assorted knives and daggers sitting out where you can get a close look at them.

Olgan Minor, the proprietor, leans against the counter, watching you intently.

>[209] buy dagger 
Pieter leans over your shoulder as you inspect the daggers. "Having the right weapon is as important as knowing what to do with it," he tells you. "You don't want big or fancy; you want something sharp, long enough to do damage to a man when you stick him with it, but slim enough to hide under your, er..." he suddenly blushes and clears his throat. "Anyway. That one," he says, pointing to a plain-handled blade about six inches long. "That's the one you want."

Olgan Minor grumbles, but Pieter glares at him again and suggests that if your gold is no good here, then perhaps some other metal might suit the shopkeeper better. Grudgingly, Minor hands over the knife and sheath, and makes a show of biting your gold coin to make sure of its worth.

Pieter stands close to you protectively.

>[210] sw
Evening is falling over the city, and the streets are clearing of people. The ball at Lord's Keep will be starting soon - you'd better hurry!

Commerce Street
Commerce Street at night is eerily quiet and empty. Your footsteps seem to echo on the cobbles as you walk past the shuttered shopfronts.

>[211] test ballgoing

Grubber's Market
At night, the normally crowded marketplace is an empty maze of shadows, abandoned stalls and rolled-up canvas. The Lord's Road lies north, your little alley lies northwest, and Commerce Street lies back east.

>[213] n

Lord's Road
The wide and well-paved Lord's Road runs from Toresal's North Market Gate straight north to Lord's Keep, a mile or so from the city. To the east are rolling pastures; to the west, broken ground and scrub.

>[214] e

Pasture
This wide, open field is used by the city for tourneys and other holiday events, or by cattle-sellers driving their livestock to market. Tonight it is empty except for the occasional cow pie. To the north you can see the dark, rough edge of a forest.

>[215] n

Stream
A small stream bubbles out of the woods and cuts through the pasture's north end. The edge of the forest lies to the north, just across the water. The city is far away to the south.

>[216] n
You're a bit more confident on the rocks this time, having had a bit of practice. Carefully lifting your skirts (you're still getting used to moving around in a dress), you pick your way over the stream with little difficulty.

Pieter, on the other hand, stumbles halfway across and lurches into the water, soaking his trousers up to the knee. You do your best to stifle your laughter as he sloshes his way to shore, cursing and grumbling something about "gratitude" and "youth today."

Small Woods
You are in the woodlands just southeast of Lord's Keep, following the game trails that wind their way through strands of pale birch and black spruce. There is just enough moonlight trickling through the upper branches to see your way by. A bubbling stream flows out of the forest to the south, into an open pasture.

>[217] n

Clearing
The woods open out here in a small, moonlit clearing. The ruins of an old pavilion lie here, pale pavestones poking up like bones from the grass.

In the center of the clearing stands a crumbling fountain, topped by a cracked statue of Brigid pouring an urn.

>[218] press bolt
The metal knob pushes in, then pops out again with a click. Suddenly there is a deep, solid thunk, and a scraping sound coming from the stone beneath you. Just as it did before, part of the statue's base swings inward.

Pieter raises his eyebrows. "Huh," he says, "I never knew about that."

Pieter shifts his feet impatiently. "We need to be on our way," he mutters. "The ball starts soon."

>[219] d

Underneath The Fountain
The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.

You can see some steps here.

>[220] n
Ducking your head to avoid the low ceiling, you follow the tunnel for some distance.

Tunnel End
The tunnel ends here at a blank, stone wall.

>[221] search wall
Carefully, you run your fingertips across the wall, trying to remember where Bobby found the loose brick the last time you were here.

Pieter stands close to you protectively.

>[222] pull brick
You manage to get your fingers in around the edge of the brick and pull it out.

"Don't worry," Pieter mutters, as much to himself as to you.
 "I won't let anything happen to you."

>[223] pull lever
The lever moves slightly, then snaps back with a click. The wall swings away, revealing shadows beyond.

Pieter looks impressed. "You're full of secrets and surprises, aren't you?" You can't bring yourself to tell him that you learned all your secrets from Bobby.

Pieter stands close to you protectively.

>[224] n

Chapel
The chapel of the Goddesses is a spacious, octagonal room, empty of furniture. The wood-paneled walls glow warmly, reflecting the light from dozens of devotional candles; the high ceiling disappears in the shadows overhead. A corridor leads southwest, and a secret passage in the south wall leads into subterranean gloom.

>[225] sw

Lower Bailey
The lower bailey has been cleaned, with gravel spread over the larger mud puddles. Guests to the ball are still trickling in through the gate to the south. The doors to the inner keep stand open to the north, and music and laughter drift out into the evening air.

Steep stone steps climb up to the top of the wall.

>[226] n
A servant in formal livery bows, then takes your and Pieter's cloaks and deftly spirits them away.

Entrance Hall
The entrance hall has been decorated for the occasion, its stark, stone walls hidden behind festive tapestries and garlands. A few guests stand around in groups, chatting, but the main event seems to be in the ballroom, north of here.

>[227] n
You step into a world of light...

Ballroom
Hundreds of candles spread an unearthly golden glow throughout the hall. From massive chandeliers dripping with crystal, from golden candelabras ensconced in the walls, the multitude of flames flicker like stars. The ballroom is packed with people; all of Toresal's high society seems to be here tonight, and still the enormous hall does not seem full. Servants navigate through the crowds, carrying silver platters loaded with pastries and canapés. Somewhere, a chamber group is playing a lively concerto.

It's breathtaking. It's every fantasy of beauty and riches that you ever dreamed of, brought to life.

Time passes.

"Well now," says a gruff voice behind you. You turn and are startled to see a familiar face - it's Jacobs, your former cellmate from the jailhouse!

Then you realize - no, it's not him. This man has the same heavy brow and hulking build, but he's older, more jowly, and his hair is gray at the temples. This must be Jacobs' father, the wealthy and notorious merchant.

The elder Jacobs leers at you. "You must be the one my boy helped out of prison recently." You remember it the other way around, actually, but before you can say anything he holds up a pudgy, ring-encrusted hand. "Don't bother denying it, I have informants everywhere. I know exactly who you are...and why you were in a prison cell." Jacobs laughs. "Don't worry, I've no plans to reveal your presence to Fossville. There's nothing in it for me, after all, since he will most certainly find out about it without my help."

>[230] z
Time passes.

He draws close to you, close enough that you can smell the spiced wine on his breath. "The way I see it, you owe my son quite a favor," he murmurs in your ear. "The way I see it, you'll be owing many people favors before you're done. But if you're to start off well, you'll need to know who those people are.

"Over there is the queen," Jacobs says, pointing across the room to a woman you can barely see for all the servants and courtiers pressed around her. "She knows who you are, too. Best to not cross her path tonight, though I doubt you'll get close enough even if you try.

"And there's her daughter, working the room," he continues. He points out a beautiful young woman who seems to be deliberately ignoring the fact that you're staring at her. "She's Fossville's quarry tonight, but every warm-blooded male with an ounce of ambition will be trying to woo her anyway."

Slowly, Jacobs turns you full circle, pointing out notable guests as they come into view. "The Duke and Duchess of Inhyron, in the Seven Lakes region. An old family, very influential. Insufferably snobbish, as well, but at least they liked your father. And there's the Baron and Baroness of Amhyron. You'll like them; they're a bit less formal, and less likely to hold your lack of upbringing against you. On the other hand, they're utterly beholden to the Inhyron Duchy. Of course, there's always the Earl of Bresa," Jacobs sighs, "a merchant lord from the Kozar Delta. A foolish man with a purchased title. He has all the money in the world, but no power, because he is utterly indiscriminate in how he spends it."

Jacobs claps you on the back in a most uncourtly fashion. "Well, my dear, that should be enough to get you started, at least." Suddenly you can feel his whiskers against your ear. "And now you owe me a favor," he whispers, and then he wanders off to mingle with the other guests, chuckling to himself.

>[231] z
Time passes.

>[232] ask baron about a
Amhyron smiles as you approach. "Good evening, milady," he says, bowing and taking your hand. "I don't believe I've had the pleasure of an introduction. I am Lord Falton, Baron of Amhyron. And you are?"

"Lady Jacqueline," you manage, "of, er... of Toresal."

The Baron's eyebrows are raised in surprise as he straightens up. "Do tell. How...intriguing. How may I be of service to you this evening, Lady Jacqueline?"

>[233] ask queen about b
With so many people crowding around trying to get the Queen's attention, you can't even get near her.

>[234] ask duke about c
With an awkward curtsey and muttered apologies, you end your conversation with the Baron of Amhyron and make your way over to the Duke of Inhyron.

Duke Inhyron inclines his head as you approach. "No need for introductions," he says sternly. "I am aware of who you are, and I see no reason to incriminate either of us by announcing it." He looks you up and down with only a slight squint of disapproval. "Your father was a good ruler and a good man," he says, "and though I do not think you have what it takes to fill his shoes, he was a friend, and you are his kin. What would you know of me, girl?"

>[235] ask duchess about d
The Duchess shrinks back, as though startled that you would deign to speak to her at all.

The Duke looks at you sternly. "I am not inclined to idle gossip, girl," he says. "If you have nothing important to ask me about, then please stop wasting both of our time."

>[236] ask earl about e
With an awkward curtsey and muttered apologies, you end your conversation with the Duke of Inhyron and make your way over to the Earl of Bresa.

"What's that?" Earl Bresa roars after you introduce yourself. "An up-and-comer, eh? Well, you seem more appealing than the rest of this stodgy crew!" He seems utterly unconcerned that anyone else might hear him - although it seems like most of the other guests are making an effort to ignore him anyway. "Listen," he says, putting his hand on your arm. "I like you. You need anything, backing, whatever, you just let me know. Now, what was it you wanted to talk about?"

>[237] ask jacobs about f
With an awkward curtsey and muttered apologies, you end your conversation with the Earl of Bresa and make your way over to Jacobs the Elder.

Jacobs purses his thick lips. "Back for more, hmm?"

>[238] ask princess about g
With an awkward curtsey and muttered apologies, you end your conversation with Jacobs the Elder and make your way over to the Princess.

The Princess pointedly ignores you for a few moments, then, when it's clear that you're not going to go away, crosses her arms and snaps, "Oh, you must be that ambitious little street urchin Mother told me about. How charming."

>[239] ask baron about h
With an awkward curtsey and muttered apologies, you end your conversation with the Princess and make your way over to the Baron of Amhyron.

"Pardon me," someone says in a low, strangely accented voice, and a hand touches your elbow. You turn to see a tall, dark-skinned man leaning close to you. "Please forgive my forwardness," he murmurs. "I have been waiting for the right moment to speak to you for some time now, but I fear if I wait much longer, I will never get the chance."

He nods towards the ballroom entrance - where several of Fossville's mercenaries are standing!

"Allow me to introduce myself," the stranger says, as though nothing at all were amiss. "I am Prince Gravesal."

The Prince glances over your shoulder and smiles sardonically. "It would seem that your company is desired by someone with greater powers of persuasion than mine." He looks back at you. "Thank you. I hope I will see you again."

He bows deeply; his lips are cool against the back of your hand. And then he is lost in the crowd, as suddenly as he appeared.

A rough hand falls on your shoulder. "Come with us, girl," growls a familiar voice. "The Baron asked us not to drag you out kicking and screaming, so let's not disappoint him, eh?"

The mercenaries march you out of the ballroom, through the foyer, and into the inner reaches of the keep. At every doorway you pass a pair of Lord's Guards standing at attention; some of them glare at the ill-kempt and ill-disciplined mercenaries, but no one makes a move to stop them or help you. You are keenly aware of the dagger strapped to your leg under your dress, but there seems to be no opportunity to use it. Not that you'd last very long against a half-dozen armed men anyway.

 The last door is not guarded. The mercenaries push you through into a room filled with dim, flickering light.

War Room
A fireplace lights this grim chamber with a hellish, red glow. A huge, round table sits in the center of the room. Hanging opposite the fireplace is a vast map of Miradan, covering nearly the entire wall. An iron-reinforced door leads east.

Pieter is lying on the floor in front of the fire place, trussed up and gagged.

On the blackwood table is a map.

You can also see Baron Fossville here.

Someone steps out of the shadows and walks over to stand between you and Pieter. The fire throws his shadow across the length of the room, huge and quivering.

"You know, it's funny," says Baron Fossville, "when I first began planning this venture, I always assumed that you would be the easiest obstacle to take care of."

>[269] test warroom

Time passes.

"Poisoning your father, now that was easy." The baron laughs. "Took a lot of patience. Bit by bit, for weeks and months. So many servants to bribe. But the old fool never suspected a thing. Thought he was only sick until the very end."

He glares at you, eyes glowing in the fire light. "Would that I'd been as patient with you."

>[271] z
Time passes.

Fossville smiles. "But all that's done with now. Once I realized that you were being manipulated into making your own play for the throne-" He stops and glances at you. "You do realize you're being manipulated, don't you? No one really thinks gutter-trash like you has a legitimate claim to the throne, no matter who your father was; your "backers" are just using you as a pawn to further their own political ends. Where was I?" He pauses, scratching his chin. "Ah, yes. Once I realized what you were up to, I knew you would show up here. And now this tiresome little game is nearly over, but for a few loose ends."

He holds out his hand. "The letter, please."

>[272] z
Time passes.

>[273] z
Time passes.

Pieter struggles weakly against his bonds.

The Baron rolls his eyes. "Oh, for the love of - hold her, please?"

The mercenaries seize you and pin your arms behind your back, while the Baron subjects you to a rough and undignified search. "You bring this on yourself," he growls, "always insisting on doing things the hard way... ah-ha!" He finds the letter hidden in a fold of your gown and yanks it free.

He didn't find the dagger, you think. I still have that.

>[274] z
Time passes.

>[275] z
Time passes.

Fossville holds the letter up to the light, shaking his head slightly as he reads the old words. "Such a nuisance," he mutters. "I can hardly believe it was under my nose all these years, and I never found it. Well, let it be a lesson." And without another word, he walks over to the fireplace and tosses the letter in.

The dry parchment catches instantly, flares up - and it's gone. Your history, your heritage, your one shot at a world beyond the crumbling orphanage and the back alleys of the city - your life - gone in a flash and a swirl of ashes up the chimney. The shock of it hits you like a punch in the gut.

Fossville draws his sword and admires its blade, glowing in the firelight. He smiles as he approaches you, raising his weapon. "And now there's just one last - eh?" He stops, looks to the door.

You can hear shouting outside, the sound of metal ringing on metal.

>[276] z
Time passes.

Suddenly the door bursts open - a mercenary staggers backwards into the room, crashes into the table - men rush in, shouting, swords flashing - Your breath catches in your throat.

It's Bobby!

"Jack! Behind me!" he shouts, slamming his fist into a mercenary's face. He flashes you that devil-may-care grin of his before slashing his way into the room, making a beeline for Baron Fossville.

>[277] attack fossville
You try to get close enough to get in a jab with your dagger, but Bobby pushes you back just as the Baron's backswing nearly takes off your head. "No, Jack!" he yells, "Leave him to me!"

Pieter strains against the ropes holding him.

Fossville counterattacks, slashing brutally at Bobby's face. Bobby falls back, parrying each blow, until his back hits the edge of the table. "Give it up, Fossville!" pants Bobby. "You are guilty of murdering the Duke! Your bid for the throne is over!"

The Baron roars and brings his sword up for a killing blow, but Bobby jumps up onto the table, rolls over it, and lands on the other side. He's breathing hard - perhaps the Baron is a better swordsman than Bobby had anticipated.

>[278] cut ropes
Working quickly, you saw through the ropes holding Pieter. "Thank you," he gasps, rubbing feeling back into his wrists. Then he grabs up the sword of a fallen mercenary and rushes to Bobby's aid.

Bobby and Pieter fight side by side, attacking one after the other so that the Baron has no chance to counter. He falls back before their onslaught, stumbles... and then he turns and runs out the door, calling for his mercenaries to defend him.

With a shout, Pieter gives chase. Bobby turns to you, grinning. "Wait for me here, Jack," he says. "We'll catch that villain quick enough, and then I'll explain everything." And then with a bound, he is gone.

At that moment, there is a sudden crack and a rumbling, and a cold draft rushes into the room, tugging at the flames in the fireplace and throwing the room into wildly pitching shadow.

Behind you, the map wall has opened to reveal a dark, cavernous passageway, and more men are rushing out - men dressed all in black, with dark hoods and scarves hiding their faces.

"That's her! Get her!" cries a voice. A young woman's voice. A voice you've heard before.

It happens so fast. Hands are on you, lifting you off your feet, wresting the dagger from your grasp, pulling you back into that dark, dark tunnel. The firelight falls away, shrinks down to a flickering, orange rectangle. The rumbling starts again, and the rectangle grows narrower, narrower...

"Don't worry," says the voice. "We're not going to, like, hurt you."

And then everything is black.
