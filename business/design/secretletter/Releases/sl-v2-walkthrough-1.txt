You nimbly hop up on top of the crates; from there, it's only a short scramble to the roof of the market.

Outer Market Roof
You're perched atop the red tile roof of the storehouse. From here you have a good view of the market's northwest junction and Lord's Road leading out of town to the north.

A group of tough-looking mercenaries has gathered at the Northwest Junction. One of them is barking orders at the others in an angry voice.

"...we know he skulks Grubber's most mornings, so spread out quick, cover all streets from the square," growls one of them, evidently the group's leader.

(Remember, you can type "help" if you need assistance.)

>[4] z
Time passes.

The leader spits on the dusty ground. "Keep your eyes open and don't take guff. But for the love of Brigid, keep your tempers and your swords sheathed unless you really need 'em. Ain't bein' paid to toss the locals."

(Remember, you can type "help" if you need assistance.)

>[5] z
Time passes.

"And keep sharp!" the leader snaps. "Remember this is a kid we're lookin' for. Kids move fast, stay out of sight, slip through crowds easy. I find out later he got away under your nose, I'll have it off!"

Suddenly, that bit of apple you swallowed a minute ago turns into a cold, hard chunk in your belly.

(The help system will now turn off its reminder, but you can always type "help" at any time.)

>[6] z
Time passes.

"Now, everyone memorize the description." The leader pulls a dirty, folded bit of parchment from his belt and squints at it. "Shoulder-length brown hair," he reads, haltingly. "Green eyes. Slight of build. Ten, maybe twelve spans high." He holds his hand out flat, at what happens to be exactly your height. "Usually wears a hat and a gray cloak."

He refolds the parchment and jams it back into his belt. "You dims got all that?"

The others nod.

>[7] z
Time passes.

"Okay, go!" barks the leader, and the mercenaries set out in several directions, moving at a brisk walk. Two men go to the north gates and start shoving them closed; the others enter the crowded market and start shoving their way through the suddenly flabbergasted crowds.

Your heart sinks. This is definitely not good.

>[8] d
As you climb back down the crates, one of them wobbles and your foot slips. You tumble loudly to the cobblestones. "Stupid! Clumsy!" you mutter, scrambling to your feet.

From the street, you hear, "What was that? Check the alley!"

Two mercenaries rush in and spot you immediately. They approach warily, their arms spread wide.

You're in trouble now...

>[9] se
You dash away into the crowd, weaving between customers and pushing your way through the thickest knots of people. The mercenaries pound after you, yelling and shoving people out of their way, but they're too big and too slow, and you quickly manage to lose them.

Northwest Junction
This is the northwest corner of Grubber's Market. You can skirt around the edge of the market to the northeast or south, or head into the thick of it to the east or southeast. A wide, paved road leads north. You can also duck back into the alley to the northwest.

The north gates leading to Lord's Road are closed.

>[10] s

Herb Stall
The herb stall is usually a quiet place. Customers here like to browse, poke their noses into the various jars, and judge the potency of a potential purchase at their leisure. Other stalls are to the south, and east, and the market opens out a little to the north.

>[11] s

Exotic Gems Stall
Dozens of jewels in exotic colors and cuts are spread out on display here, glittering in the dusty sunlight. Some of them are loose stones, others are set in finely wrought rings and necklaces. Most of them were probably smuggled in from over the western mountains, which is why they're cheap enough to be affordable to anyone in Grubber's Market. Still, they're far, far out of your price range. Other stalls lie to the north, northeast, east, and southeast.

Suddenly you hear a commotion from the back of the stall: the crash of a display case hitting the ground; shouts and curses from the stallkeeper; and a horrific, gibbering shriek.

"Come back here, you flea-bitten thief!" yells the stallkeeper, and for a panicked moment you think he means you. Then you see something small and gray dart up to the roof of the stall...it's just a forest monkey, probably someone's pet running loose. And it's clutching one of the stallkeeper's necklaces in its tiny black fist.

The monkey turns and screeches back at the stallkeeper, dodges a clumsily thrown dirt clod, and scampers away.

>[12] ne

Rope Stall
One thing you can say about the rope stall: you'll never spend a moment wondering what's for sale. It's all rope, and lots of it: thick and thin, knotted and loose, in heaps and in coils, stacked on the ground and dangling in loops. More stalls are to the northeast, southeast, west, and southwest, and the market opens out a bit to the northwest.

A tall wooden post is visible behind the stall.

The stallkeeper haggles with a customer over the price of rope.

>[13] ne

Candlemaker's Stall
The heat and fumes from the candlemaker's tallow pots make this stall an unpleasant place to loiter. Still, people need candles, and customers seem to be buying them as fast as the stallkeeper can dip them. Most of the candles are tallow, fast-burning and cheap, but there are also a number of premade wax candles in different colors. Other stalls are to the north, east, west, southeast, and southwest.

Behind the stall is a tall wooden post.

An ugly shopper shoves you out of the way, muttering something about "street trash".

>[15] xyzzy
A hollow voice whispers "groo."

>[16] e

Fruit Stall
Bins heaped high with brightly colored fruit lend a pleasant fragrance to this end of the market (though by afternoon it will have become a cloying reek that attracts more flies than customers). They have apples and pears from the city orchards, and brambleberries from the northern counties. Oranges, limes, kello fruit - even a bushel of bananas from the Kozar Delta. Aisles between the stalls lead northwest, west, southwest, and south.

"You'll not find better apples in all of Toresal!" calls the stallkeeper.

>[17] steal banana
Ah, this is something you know how to do, at least. You sidle up casually to the stall, wait until the stallkeeper seems preoccupied, then reach out and pluck the banana from the shelf.

Suddenly the stallkeeper jabs his finger at you and screams, "Stop, thief!"

One of the mercenaries happens to be wandering by at that moment. He hears the stallkeeper's shouts and comes running straight for you!

Then there is a loud screech, and something gray and hairy scampers out from under the mercenary's feet. He stumbles, trips, and pitches headlong into the fruit stall. Fruit scatters everywhere. The stallkeeper is wailing and berating the mercenary, who is covered with juice and slimy pulp.

In the general chaos, you slip away easily, stuffing the banana into your satchel. Fortunately, no one managed to get a very good look at you, and the stallkeeper will be too busy cleaning up his wares to keep an eye out for you. You shouldn't have any trouble coming back here if you need to.

Eastern Junction
You're near the eastern edge of Grubber's Market. Commerce Street lies to the east. You can travel along the outer ring of stalls to the north or south, or head towards the market's central hub to the west.

>[34] e
Just as you reach the edge of the market square, you notice the mercenary captain standing watch at the entrance to Commerce Street. His eyes fall on you before you can duck out of the way, and the next moment you are sprinting back into the market with the captain hot on your heels. You manage to lose him in the crowd... barely.

Pottery Stall
The wares at the pottery stall are spread out on the ground, forcing browsers and passers-by to step carefully around them. The urns, jars, and bowls are each uniquely shaped, yet they all share a common, graceful curve. Most of them are made of fired clay from the Westlands, decorated with colorful glazes. There are more stalls to the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest, or you can head out to the market's edge to the east.

A tall wooden post is visible behind the stall.

Hat Stall
Hats of all styles and sizes hang from scores of wooden pegs, a forest of varied headgear. They have big, flop-brimmed traveling hats; small, leather workman's caps; wide sappans of woven straw from the Kozar delta; fancy, feathered hats for courtly balls; and even a few ordinary bonnets. More stalls lie to the north, northwest, west, and southwest.

Leather Stall
You pause here for a few deep breaths - you've always enjoyed the smell around the leather merchant's stall. This merchant mostly deals in riding equipment - reins, harnesses, stirrups, and the like. A full riding saddle sits on proud display near the back. There are a few scabbards and belts for sale, as well. More stalls lie to the west, northwest, and northeast.

Outside the Silk Tent
Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or move on to one of the many other stalls to the east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest.

Rising up behind the tent is a tall wooden post.

A red-faced matron squeezes past you.

You beat on the mercenary's arms with your fists, but the man is just too strong.

The captain soon arrives, followed by two more of his men. One of them grabs your other arm as their leader smiles. "Good work, dims. Got ourselves a nice little commission with this one." And before you can react, he takes a sack of black cloth from his belt and jerks it down over your head.

Everything goes dark. You can't breathe. You struggle, but you can no more break the iron grip on your arms than you could uproot a tree. The men holding you curse. Dimly, you hear shouts from the crowd - someone protesting this rough treatment of a child.

"Don't worry, m'lady," laughs the mercenary leader. "We'll treat the little rat nice an' gentle. Like this, see?"

Something huge and heavy crashes into your head, and the rest of your senses are yanked away. Why they wanted you, you never awake to find out.
