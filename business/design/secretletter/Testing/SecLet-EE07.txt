>x me
Most people know you as "Jack," a fourteen-year-old street urchin of uncertain means. You are slight of build for a boy your age, though your baggy clothes hide much of your physique. Your shoulder-length hair is ragged, a victim of many self-inflicted trimmings. Though usually in need of a good scrubbing, you are an attractive youth, with a softness to your face that makes you seem younger than your years.

Fortunately, it also leads people to underestimate your wiles and resourcefulness, which have caused more than one stallkeeper to call you by your second most common sobriquet, "Lousy thief!"

Only a few people know you by your real name, and you are pleased to keep it that way.

The voices are still talking outside the alley.

>i
You are carrying: 
  your clothes (being worn)
  your old gray cloak (being worn)
  your satchel (which is open, but empty)
  your hat (being worn)
  an apple

The men continue their conversation at the entrance to the alley.

>eat apple
No time for breakfast right now!

You can still hear the men outside the alley continue their conversation.

>smell
It smells pretty ripe back here.

The voices are still talking just outside the alley.

>jump
You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

You can still hear the men continue their conversation at the entrance to the alley.

>listen
You strain to hear what the men are saying, but can't make out the words. Maybe if you got some elevation, you could hear better.

You can still hear the voices just outside the alley talking.

>x clothes
Your clothing is baggy and threadbare. 

The voices just outside the alley continue their conversation.

>doff clothes
This isn't the time or place for getting undressed!

You can still hear the voices talking outside the alley.

>l
Alley
This narrow alley is tucked away between a storehouse on one side and the canvas wall of a stallkeeper's tent on the other. It serves primarily as somewhere out-of-the-way for stallkeepers to sweep their garbage, so it's not exactly the most pleasant-smelling place in all of Miradania, but at least no one is likely to bother you here. You can leave to the southeast.

Several crates are stacked up against the back wall of the alley.

You can still hear the men at the entrance to the alley continue their conversation.

>x crates
Just ordinary wooden crates, used by merchants throughout Miradania to store and ship goods. There are scores more just like these to be found all over the market. 

The men continue talking outside the alley.

>look in crates
The crates are all nailed shut.

You can still hear the men talking at the entrance to the alley.

>climb on crates
You nimbly hop up on top of the crates; from there, it's only a short scramble to the roof of the market.

Outer Market Roof
You're perched atop the red tile roof of the storehouse. From here you have a good view of the market's northwest junction and Lord's Road leading out of town to the north.

A group of tough-looking mercenaries has gathered at the Northwest Junction. One of them is barking orders at the others in an angry voice.

"...we know he skulks Grubber's most mornings, so spread out quick, cover all streets from the square," growls one of them, evidently the group's leader.

>jump
You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

The leader spits on the dusty ground. "Keep your eyes open and don't take guff. But for the love of Brigid, keep your tempers and your swords sheathed unless you really need 'em. Ain't bein' paid to toss the locals."

>** The jump response seems inappropriate here (atop the roof)
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x tough-looking mercenaries
You can't see any such thing.

>x mercenaries
They're not Lord's Guards, that's for sure. They wear no insignia, for one thing. Their arms and armor are mismatched, ugly, and scarred - not an unfit description of the men themselves, either. Also, while the Guard would be concerned with keeping the peace in Grubber's Market, these bravos look ready to clobber anyone who gets in their way, and maybe burn down a few stalls while they're at it.

So what are they doing here, you wonder? And come to think of it, where are the Lord's Guards, anyway? 

"And keep sharp!" the leader snaps. "Remember this is a kid we're lookin' for. Kids move fast, stay out of sight, slip through crowds easy. I find out later he got away under your nose, I'll have it off!"

Suddenly, that bit of apple you swallowed a minute ago turns into a cold, hard chunk in your belly.

>** Extra vocab (tough-looking) needed?
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x apple
The apple is round, firm, green at the bottom shading up to red near the stem. There is a big bite taken out of one side. 

"Now, everyone memorize the description." The leader pulls a dirty, folded bit of parchment from his belt and squints at it. "Shoulder-length brown hair," he reads, haltingly. "Green eyes. Slight of build. Ten, maybe twelve spans high." He holds his hand out flat, at what happens to be exactly your height. "Usually wears a hat and a gray cloak."

He refolds the parchment and jams it back into his belt. "You dims got all that?"

The others nod.

>sing
No way. Your singing is enough to make your friend Holstenoffer wince, and he can stomach anything.

"Okay, go!" barks the leader, and the mercenaries set out in several directions, moving at a brisk walk. Two men go to the north gates and start shoving them closed; the others enter the crowded market and start shoving their way through the suddenly flabbergasted crowds.

Your heart sinks. This is definitely not good.

>down
As you climb back down the crates, one of them wobbles and your foot slips. You tumble loudly to the cobblestones. "Stupid! Clumsy!" you mutter, scrambling to your feet.

From the street, you hear, "What was that? Check the alley!"

Two mercenaries rush in and spot you immediately. They approach warily, their arms spread wide.

You're in trouble now...

>x mercenaries
Rough and ugly, with dirty clothes and mean, scarred faces. They carry serious-looking swords on their hips. 

>bite them
Thinking quickly, you kick the mercenary in the shin.

"Argh! Oh, you miserable runt-" He stumbles backwards into his companion. Now they're both distracted; now's your chance to run!

>** Okay, I understand that "bite" is being understood as "attack" here, but "kick" is a slightly odd interpretation of "bite"
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>east
This alley is a dead end. The only way out is to the southeast.

>eat mercenaries
(first taking the mercenaries)
I don't suppose the mercenaries would care for that.

A rock-hard fist closes around your upper arm. "Gotcha!" the mercenary yells. The other one starts hollering for his companions.

>** The response here seems less than ideal (granted it's a daft action)
I didn't understand that sentence.

>run
(to the southeast)
You pull and struggle, but the man is just too strong.

>hit man
Thinking quickly, you elbow the mercenary as hard as you can, aiming below the belt.

"Argh! Oh, you miserable runt-" the mercenary's grip on your arm loosens, and you twist away. You're free!

>run
(to the southeast)
You dash away into the crowd, weaving between customers and pushing your way through the thickest knots of people. The mercenaries pound after you, yelling and shoving people out of their way, but they're too big and too slow, and you quickly manage to lose them.

Northwest Junction
This is the northwest corner of Grubber's Market. You can skirt around the edge of the market to the northeast or south, or head into the thick of it to the east or southeast. A wide, paved road leads north. You can also duck back into the alley to the northwest.

The north gates leading to Lord's Road are closed.

>ne

Grocery Stall
This is a typical grocer's stall, with various kinds of food set out. There are baskets bristling with loaves of bread, yellow pyramids of cheese, and spiced jerky hanging in bundles overhead. You can continue along the market's outer ring to the southwest or southeast, or head in towards the center of the market to the south.

>x food
(as sold at this stall)
There are baskets bristling with loaves of bread, yellow pyramids of cheese, and spiced jerky hanging in bundles overhead. 

You notice a couple of the mercenaries pushing through the crowd, heading your way. They haven't seen you yet, but they're getting close.

>x spiced jerky
The jerky hangs in dried, shriveled strips, and looks just slightly more appetizing than eating your own belt. 

>eat cheese
(first taking the cheese)
Ah, this is something you know how to do, at least. You sidle up casually to the stall, wait until the stallkeeper seems preoccupied, then reach out and pluck the cheese from its shelf.

Suddenly the stallkeeper jabs his finger at you and screams, "Stop, thief!"

Apparently, he wasn't quite as preoccupied as you thought.

You sprint through the crowd, stuffing the cheese into your satchel. This stallkeeper will be on the lookout for you now; probably best to stay away from this part of Grubber's for a while.

Northwest Junction
This is the northwest corner of Grubber's Market. You can skirt around the edge of the market to the northeast or south, or head into the thick of it to the east or southeast. A wide, paved road leads north. You can also duck back into the alley to the northwest.

The north gates leading to Lord's Road are closed.

>i
You are carrying: 
  your clothes (being worn)
  your old gray cloak (being worn)
  your satchel (which is open, containing:)
    a cheese
  your hat (being worn)
  an apple

>put apple in satchel
You stuff the apple into your satchel.

You notice a couple of the mercenaries pushing through the crowd, heading your way. They haven't seen you yet, but they're getting close.

>e

Candlemaker's Stall
The heat and fumes from the candlemaker's tallow pots make this stall an unpleasant place to loiter. Still, people need candles, and customers seem to be buying them as fast as the stallkeeper can dip them. Most of the candles are tallow, fast-burning and cheap, but there are also a number of premade wax candles in different colors. Other stalls are to the north, east, west, southeast, and southwest.

You see a tall wooden post rising up behind the stall.

>x post
This is the central post that holds up the canvas awnings stretched over the market square. It rises from the midst of a cluster of stalls in the middle of the market, to a height of about fifty feet. Thick, taut support wires stretch from the top of the post in four directions: northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast. 

The stallkeeper haggles with a customer over the price of white wax candles.

>x wires
The wires anchor the support posts and hold the canvas awnings in place. 

You notice a couple of the mercenaries pushing through the crowd, heading your way. They haven't seen you yet, but they're getting close.

>climb post
You need to find a way behind the stalls to get to the post.

>e

Fruit Stall
Bins heaped high with brightly colored fruit lend a pleasant fragrance to this end of the market (though by afternoon it will have become a cloying reek that attracts more flies than customers). They have apples and pears from the city orchards, and brambleberries from the northern counties. Oranges, limes, kello fruit - even a bushel of bananas from the Kozar Delta. Aisles between the stalls lead northwest, west, southwest, and south.

A sour-faced matron with crooked teeth shoves you out of the way, muttering something about "street trash".

>x limes
The dark green limes look refreshing. 

You notice a couple of the mercenaries pushing through the crowd, heading your way. They haven't seen you yet, but they're getting close.

>s

Eastern Junction
You're near the eastern edge of Grubber's Market. Commerce Street lies to the east. You can travel along the outer ring of stalls to the north or south, or head towards the market's central hub to the west.

>s

Hat Stall
Hats of all styles and sizes hang from scores of wooden pegs, a forest of varied headgear. They have big, flop-brimmed traveling hats; small, leather workman's caps; wide sappans of woven straw from the Kozar delta; fancy, feathered hats for courtly balls; and even a few ordinary bonnets. More stalls lie to the north, northwest, west, and southwest.

>x bonnets
The bonnets are just ordinary peasant wear, little white caps that tie under the chin. 

"Fine quality traveling hats for sale!" calls the stallkeeper.

>talk to stallkeeper
"What do you want?" snaps the stallkeeper.

1. "What do you have for sale?
2. "Do you know anything about these mercenaries?"
3. "I'd like to buy something, please."
4. "Good-bye."

>2
"You know anything about these mercenaries running around Grubber's?" you ask.

"Only that they're bad for business," mutters the stallkeeper. "I don't know who hired them, but the Lord's Guard ought to run them off."

You notice a couple of the mercenaries pushing through the crowd, heading your way. They haven't seen you yet, but they're getting close.

1. "What do you have for sale?
2. "I'd like to buy something, please."
3. "Good-bye."

>1
"So, what are you selling today?" you ask, trying to sound casual.

The merchant sneers at you. "You have any coin?"

1. "Yes."
2. "No."
3. "Never mind."

>2
"Um, no," you say.

The stallkeeper rolls his eyes. "Do I look like I have time to gab at you all day? Beat it, kid."

Those mercenaries are getting uncomfortably close. You'd better get going before they notice you!

>s
There's nothing in that direction except the wall that surrounds the market square.

Suddenly one of the mercenaries does a double-take and sees you. "There he is!" he yells, pointing, and both of them start shoving through the crowd towards you.

>nw
You dash away into the crowd, weaving between customers and pushing your way through the thickest knots of people. The mercenaries pound after you, yelling and shoving people out of their way, but they're too big and too slow, and you quickly manage to lose them.

Pottery Stall
The wares at the pottery stall are spread out on the ground, forcing browsers and passers-by to step carefully around them. The urns, jars, and bowls are each uniquely shaped, yet they all share a common, graceful curve. Most of them are made of fired clay from the Westlands, decorated with colorful glazes. There are more stalls to the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest, or you can head out to the market's edge to the east.

Behind the stall is a tall wooden post.

>x urns
The urns are mostly decorative, for putting flowers or rushes in. 

>x jars
The round jars are just the thing for keeping in a pantry. 

The stallkeeper carefully straightens his display of bowls.

>x bowls
The shallow bowls are ideal for holding fruit or wine. 

You notice a couple of the mercenaries pushing through the crowd, heading your way. They haven't seen you yet, but they're getting close.

>talk to stallkeeper
Better find somewhere else to chat; if you start making conversation, the mercenaries might take notice.

>sw

Outside the Silk Tent
Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or move on to one of the many other stalls to the east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest.

Rising up behind the tent is a tall wooden post.

>se

Leather Stall
You pause here for a few deep breaths - you've always enjoyed the smell around the leather merchant's stall. This merchant mostly deals in riding equipment - reins, harnesses, stirrups, and the like. A full riding saddle sits on proud display near the back. There are a few scabbards and belts for sale, as well. More stalls lie to the west, northwest, and northeast.

"Fine quality reins!" calls the stallkeeper.

>talk to stallkeeper
"What do you want?" snaps the stallkeeper.

1. "I'd like to buy something, please."
2. "Good-bye."

>2
"Yeah, fine, scram," the stallkeeper mutters.

You notice a couple of the mercenaries pushing through the crowd, heading your way. They haven't seen you yet, but they're getting close.

>w

Weaponsmith's Stall
The weaponsmith's wares hang along the sides of his stall, a grim picket fence of down-hanging blades. You can find less intimidating stalls to the east, northeast, and northwest.

The stallkeeper carefully straightens his display of knives.

>x knives
The knives are just your speed: short and wicked sharp. 

You notice a couple of the mercenaries pushing through the crowd, heading your way. They haven't seen you yet, but they're getting close.

>x stallkeeper
The stallkeeper looks nervous and irritable. Armed thugs stomping around the Grubber's Market is not good for business. 

>talk to him
Better find somewhere else to chat; if you start making conversation, the mercenaries might take notice.

Those mercenaries are getting uncomfortably close. You'd better get going before they notice you!

>nw

Exotic Gems Stall
Dozens of jewels in exotic colors and cuts are spread out on display here, glittering in the dusty sunlight. Some of them are loose stones, others are set in finely wrought rings and necklaces. Most of them were probably smuggled in from over the western mountains, which is why they're cheap enough to be affordable to anyone in Grubber's Market. Still, they're far, far out of your price range. Other stalls lie to the north, northeast, east, and southeast.

Suddenly you hear a commotion from the back of the stall: the crash of a display case hitting the ground; shouts and curses from the stallkeeper; and a horrific, gibbering shriek.

"Come back here, you flea-bitten thief!" yells the stallkeeper, and for a panicked moment you think he means you. Then you see something small and gray dart up to the roof of the stall... it's just a forest monkey, probably someone's pet running loose. And it's clutching one of the stallkeeper's necklaces in its tiny black fist.

The monkey turns and screeches back at the stallkeeper, dodges a clumsily thrown dirt clod, and scampers away.

>talk to stallkeeper
"What do you want?" snaps the stallkeeper.

1. "I'd like to buy something, please."
2. "Good-bye."

>1
"I'd like one of those, please," you say, pointing.

The merchant sneers at you. "You have any coin?"

1. "Yes."
2. "No."
3. "Never mind."

>2
"Um, no," you say.

The stallkeeper rolls his eyes. "Do I look like I have time to gab at you all day? Beat it, kid."

You notice a couple of the mercenaries pushing through the crowd, heading your way. They haven't seen you yet, but they're getting close.

>n

Herb Stall
The herb stall is usually a quiet place. Customers here like to browse, poke their noses into the various jars, and judge the potency of a potential purchase at their leisure.  Other stalls are to the south, and east, and the market opens out a little to the north.

The stallkeeper haggles with a customer over the price of herbs.

>x herbs
(as sold at this stall)
The dozens of tiny jars are filled with dried and crushed bits of leaves, roots, berries, petals, moss, bark - basically, if it's from a plant, and it smells bad, you can find some shriveled piece of it here. 

>e

Rope Stall
One thing you can say about the rope stall: you'll never spend a moment wondering what's for sale. It's all rope, and lots of it: thick and thin, knotted and loose, in heaps and in coils, stacked on the ground and dangling in loops. More stalls are to the northeast, southeast, west, and southwest, and the market opens out a bit to the northwest.

Behind the stall is a tall wooden post.

"You'll not find better rope in all of Toresal!" calls the stallkeeper.

>x rope
(as sold at this stall)
It's all rope, and lots of it: thick and thin, knotted and loose, in heaps and in coils, stacked on the floor and hanging from pegs. 

You notice a couple of the mercenaries pushing through the crowd, heading your way. They haven't seen you yet, but they're getting close.

>se

Outside the Silk Tent
Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or move on to one of the many other stalls to the east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest.

A tall wooden post is visible behind the tent.

A piebald matron with a scraggly moustache stalks by, muttering something about "penny-grubbing trinket-sellers".

>x matron
The piebald matron has already melted back into the crowd.

>* Good response!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>n

Inside the Silk Tent
The walls of the tent provide a bit of quiet and privacy from the crowds outside (in addition to keeping dust off the merchandise). Beautiful silk garments hang on either side. Gowns, robes, capes, cloaks, and shawls, the fabric rippling with the slightest movement of air, shimmering with that soft, liquid glow that only silk has. The main market lies to the south. A narrow gap to the north leads behind the tent.

Teisha sits on a stool in back, smiling distractedly.

"Hello, Jack," says Teisha. "Change your mind about that cloak?" Then she gets a look at your face and frowns. "Something the matter, sweetie? You look spooked."

1. "There are big guys with swords chasing me."
2. "Actually, I'd like to look at that cloak again."
3. "No, everything's fine."

>1
"Now that you mention it, I am a bit spooked," you say, trying to catch your breath. "There's a bunch of big guys with swords out there, chasing me all over the market!"

Teisha frowns. "Big guys with - you mean mercenaries? In Grubber's?" She peeks out through the front flap. "Brigid help us," she mutters, glancing back at you. "Don't tell me what they're after you for - I don't want to know."

1. "I need somewhere to hide."
2. "I need a disguise."

>1
"I need help, Teisha," you tell her plaintively. "I need somewhere to hide."

Teisha sighs. Although you know she cares about you, you also know that Teisha is a smart, practical woman, and first and foremost she is worried about losing her customers. "All right," she says, "you can stay in here as long as you like, but if the mercenaries decide to search the place I can't stop them. Probably your best bet is to slip out that way-" she points to the narrow gap in the back wall of the tent. "I'll pretend I never saw you."

1. "I need a disguise."
2. "Can I ask you a question?"
3. "Thanks."

>1
Suddenly your eyes fall on the many cloaks hanging among Teisha's silks. "I could use one of your cloaks as a disguise," you say. "The mercenaries expect me to be wearing my usual ratty stuff."

Teisha sighs. "Jack... I'm sorry. These silks are expensive, and I have to pay my suppliers and make a living for myself. If you have coin, or something worth trading, maybe I can cut you a deal. Otherwise..." she shakes her head.

1. "Can I ask you a question?"

>1
"Teisha, can I ask you a question?"

"Of course, Jack," she says.

1. "What can you tell me about Grubber's Market?"
2. "Who's selling what today?"
3. "What's behind your tent?"
4. "Do you make these clothes yourself?"
5. "What's the deal with that monkey?"
6. "What will you trade for a cloak?"
7. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
8. "What's this Ascension thing?"
9. "Never mind."

>1
"What can you tell me about Grubber's Market?" you ask. "Are there any other ways out of here?"

Teisha shrugs. "I figured you'd know more about the place than I do, the way you sneak about," she says. "From the northwest junction you can leave the city. East will take you to Commerce Street. Those are the only two ways out of the square, as far as I know."

1. "One more question."
2. "Thanks."

>1
"Can I ask you another question?" you ask.

"Ask away," says Teisha.

1. "What can you tell me about Grubber's Market?"
2. "Who's selling what today?"
3. "What's behind your tent?"
4. "Do you make these clothes yourself?"
5. "What's the deal with that monkey?"
6. "What will you trade for a cloak?"
7. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
8. "What's this Ascension thing?"
9. "Never mind."

>2
"I know that different merchants set up their stalls on different days of the week," you say. "So who's selling what today?"

"Well, there's the fruit stall on the northeast corner, but that's there every day," says Teisha. "To the north is a grocer's stall; a hat seller to the southeast; to the west is an herb seller and the gem merchant; and the leatherworker and weaponsmith have set up shop on the south end. The inner ring is me, a rope merchant, a pottery merchant, and that awful candlemaker - the stench has been driving off my customers all morning."

1. "One more question."
2. "Thanks."

>1
"Do you mind if I ask you one more question?" you ask.

"Of course, Jack," says Teisha.

1. "What can you tell me about Grubber's Market?"
2. "Who's selling what today?"
3. "What's behind your tent?"
4. "Do you make these clothes yourself?"

6. "What will you trade for a cloak?"
7. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
8. "What's this Ascension thing?"
9. "Never mind."

>3
"What's that behind your tent?" you ask, nodding towards the back exit.

"There's nothing back there except the central pole holding up the big awning over the market," Teisha says. "That's why all the merchants want this spot," she adds, "...it's got the best shade."

1. "One more question."
2. "Thanks."

>1
"One more question?" you ask.

"Ask away," says Teisha.

1. "What can you tell me about Grubber's Market?"
2. "Who's selling what today?"
3. "What's behind your tent?"

6. "What will you trade for a cloak?"
7. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
8. "What's this Ascension thing?"
9. "Never mind."

>4
"These clothes are all so beautiful," you say. "Do you make them yourself?"

Teisha smiles. "Some of them," she says. "Most of them I sell on consignment. One of these days, I'm going to clear enough profit to rent a shop on Commerce Street and move out of this hot, smelly tent."

1. "One more question."
2. "Thanks."

>1
"Can I ask you something else?" you ask.

"No problem," says Teisha.

1. "What can you tell me about Grubber's Market?"
2. "Who's selling what today?"
3. "What's behind your tent?"
4. "Do you make these clothes yourself?"
5. "What's the deal with that monkey?"
6. "What will you trade for a cloak?"
7. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
8. "What's this Ascension thing?"
9. "Never mind."

"I told you already," says Teisha, "some of them I make myself, some I sell for others."

1. "One more question."
2. "Thanks."

"Can I ask you another question?" you ask.

"Of course, Jack," says Teisha.

7. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
8. "What's this Ascension thing?"
9. "Never mind."

>5
"The gem merchant sounds like he's got a real vendetta against that monkey," you remark. "What's the story with them?"

Teisha rolls her eyes. "That pesky thing came in on the fruit vendor's wagon yesterday and just made itself at home. Now it's all over the place, bothering everybody. Fortunately, it likes shiny things more than it likes women's clothes. Oh, and bananas. The little rodent loves bananas. Constantly drops the peels on the roof of my tent."

1. "One more question."
2. "Thanks."

>1
"Do you mind if I ask you one more question?" you ask.

"Sure," says Teisha.

"I need one of those cloaks, Teisha," you say. "Just tell me what you want for it, and I'll get it, somehow."

Teisha thinks for a moment. "Most of the things you'd find in Grubber's are staple goods, not much use to me. I'd need something with resale value. Jewelry, or the like. But don't you go stealing anything, Jack," she adds hastily. "I don't want you getting into even more trouble than you're already in!"

Teisha laughs. "So you've noticed it too, huh? I don't usually like to talk politics, which means I haven't had much in the way of conversation in Grubber's Market lately." She shrugs. "I don't like his high taxes, but who does? Fossville doesn't strike me as a very nice person, but I guess he doesn't have to be."

"What's this Ascension thing I keep hearing about?" you ask. "Everyone in the market seems to be talking about it."

"Ascension is when they name the heir to the throne of all Miradania," Teisha says. "Everyone's talking about it because the King didn't explicitly name his daughter heir before he died, so now there's talk the new ruler might be chosen by a council of noblemen. I don't see why it's so interesting, frankly. What the King and Queen do miles away in the capital doesn't have much to do with how many cloaks I sell today."

Teisha holds the back flap back as you duck through. "Be careful now..." she says, "...Jacqueline."

Behind the Silk Tent
This is a cramped little square formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.

>x huge central support post
You can't see any such thing.

>** Missing vocab
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x support post
It's huge, almost too big to put your arms around. Way up at the top, you can see wires stretching out in each of the cardinal directions. 

>climb post
You're totally hidden back here, so there's no one to stop you from climbing. By the time you're high enough for people to see you, you're also high enough that no one will notice anyway; no one ever bothers to look up in Grubber's Market. After a minute or so of grunting and sweating, you reach the top.

Top of the Post
Perched atop the high central post, you can look out over the whole market square. To the north, Lord's Road heads out of the city towards Lord's Keep. Commerce Street and the rest of the city beckon to the east. In every other direction the city is surrounded by rolling meadows and farmlands.

Four anchor cables stretch away in four directions: northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast.

Balancing on the southeast cable is that monkey.

>x cables
There are four cables, each made of thick, braided wire. They stretch southwest, southeast, northeast, and northwest to the four corners of the market. 

>jump
You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

>** Definitely inappropriate here!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>sw
The cable is too steep for you to climb down, and the rough wire would tear up your hands. But if you had something you could loop over the cable, you might be able to slide down while hanging underneath.

The monkey hoots at you.

>x monkey
The monkey has silvery fur and black mask-like markings on its startlingly human face. It seems to regard you with a mixture of curiosity and amusement - as though you were some strange little animal whose antics it found entertaining. It grips the necklace protectively, tight against its tiny chest. The monkey is standing on the southeast cable. 

>climb down
You take a deep breath, lower yourself carefully until you're hugging the side of the pole, and let yourself slide down.

Behind the Silk Tent
This is a cramped little square formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.

Inside the Silk Tent
The walls of the tent provide a bit of quiet and privacy from the crowds outside (in addition to keeping dust off the merchandise). Beautiful silk garments hang on either side. Gowns, robes, capes, cloaks, and shawls, the fabric rippling with the slightest movement of air, shimmering with that soft, liquid glow that only silk has. The main market lies to the south. A narrow gap to the north leads behind the tent.

Teisha sits on a stool in back, smiling distractedly.

>x teisha
Teisha is a short, busty woman with a smile as warm as her tumbling red curls. She likes you, and she knows that you'd never nick from her stall, so she lets you hang around the stall and look through the merchandise. She also knows your big secret (guessed it the very first time she caught you loitering at the tent flap), which is a little bit scary and a little bit of a relief - it's nice to be able to let your guard down and talk to someone outside Maiden House. 

Teisha toys with her measuring cord, spinning it idly.

>kiss her
You throw your arms around Teisha's neck and give her a kiss on the cheek. She laughs and looks at you strangely. "What's got into you, Jack?"

Teisha brushes a loose thread from the sleeve of one of her gowns.

>s

Outside the Silk Tent
Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or move on to one of the many other stalls to the east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest.

Rising up behind the tent is a tall wooden post.

>ne

Pottery Stall
The wares at the pottery stall are spread out on the ground, forcing browsers and passers-by to step carefully around them. The urns, jars, and bowls are each uniquely shaped, yet they all share a common, graceful curve. Most of them are made of fired clay from the Westlands, decorated with colorful glazes. There are more stalls to the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest, or you can head out to the market's edge to the east.

Behind the stall is a tall wooden post.

The stallkeeper haggles with a customer over the price of bowls.

>ne

Fruit Stall
Bins heaped high with brightly colored fruit lend a pleasant fragrance to this end of the market (though by afternoon it will have become a cloying reek that attracts more flies than customers). They have apples and pears from the city orchards, and brambleberries from the northern counties. Oranges, limes, kello fruit - even a bushel of bananas from the Kozar Delta. Aisles between the stalls lead northwest, west, southwest, and south.

The stallkeeper carefully straightens his display of kello fruit.

>steal banana
With the stallkeepers all on edge about the mercenaries, it's not likely you'll be able to nick anything without someone noticing. Still, nothing ventured...

"Thief!"

One of the mercenaries happens to be wandering by at that moment. He hears the stallkeeper's shouts and comes running straight for you!

Then there is a loud screech, and something gray and hairy scampers out from under the mercenary's feet. He stumbles, trips, and pitches headlong into the fruit stall. Fruit scatters everywhere. The stallkeeper is wailing and berating the mercenary, who is covered with juice and slimy pulp.

In the general chaos, you slip away easily, stuffing the banana into your satchel. Fortunately, no one managed to get a very good look at you, and the stallkeeper will be too busy cleaning up his wares to keep an eye out for you. You shouldn't have any trouble coming back here if you need to.

Candlemaker's Stall
The heat and fumes from the candlemaker's tallow pots make this stall an unpleasant place to loiter. Still, people need candles, and customers seem to be buying them as fast as the stallkeeper can dip them. Most of the candles are tallow, fast-burning and cheap, but there are also a number of premade wax candles in different colors. Other stalls are to the north, east, west, southeast, and southwest.

You see a tall wooden post rising up behind the stall.

>sw

Rope Stall
One thing you can say about the rope stall: you'll never spend a moment wondering what's for sale. It's all rope, and lots of it: thick and thin, knotted and loose, in heaps and in coils, stacked on the ground and dangling in loops. More stalls are to the northeast, southeast, west, and southwest, and the market opens out a bit to the northwest.

A tall wooden post is visible behind the stall.

>sw

Exotic Gems Stall
Dozens of jewels in exotic colors and cuts are spread out on display here, glittering in the dusty sunlight. Some of them are loose stones, others are set in finely wrought rings and necklaces. Most of them were probably smuggled in from over the western mountains, which is why they're cheap enough to be affordable to anyone in Grubber's Market. Still, they're far, far out of your price range. Other stalls lie to the north, northeast, east, and southeast.

Four anchor cables stretch away in four directions: northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast.

Balancing on the southeast cable is that monkey.

>show banana to monkey
(first taking the banana)
You hold out the banana and wiggle it enticingly. "Here, monkey. C'mon, little monkey," you whisper, trying to ignore how stupid it sounds.

The monkey creeps closer, eyes locked on the yellow fruit. It's only about a foot away from your out-stretched hand now. Its little face contorts into bizarre expressions as it wrestles with the conflicting desires to grab the tasty treat, hold onto the shiny trinket, and stay out of your reach, all at the same time.

Suddenly the monkey lunges. You make a grab with your free hand. The monkey grabs the banana just as your fingers hook around the necklace's chain. The monkey screams, jumps six feet straight up, lands on your head, and scampers off down the wire behind you. Your heart leaps into your throat as you lose your balance on top of the pole. You totter, pinwheel your arms... and stay on.

You're breathing hard, but you're safe. And you have the necklace.

Somewhere far below you, a stallkeeper is cursing and wiping smushed banana off his face.

Teisha sits on a stool in back, smiling distractedly.

>show necklace to teisha
You hold out the necklace, dangling it by its chain. "Have a look at this, Teisha," you say. "You think this is worth one of your cloaks?"

Teisha's eyebrow shoots up, but she manages to hide her excitement with the coolness of a professional haggler. "That's not bad," she mutters. "Most of Hathid's wares are just pretty glass, but this..." She gives you a look. "Now, tell me the truth, Jack, you didn't just steal this from somewhere, did you?"

You shake your head proudly. It's not exactly a lie.

"Well, not that it matters." The necklace disappears into one of Teisha's pockets. "Let's see..." she starts searching through the clothes, looking for something in your size. "This should fit. I think it suits you, too." She holds out a light green cloak. "What do you think?"

It takes your breath away, but you try to hide your eagerness just as Teisha hid hers. "It's tricky," you say, nodding casually.

Teisha laughs. "Then it's yours."

Suddenly you hear someone shouting just outside: "Hey, any of you dims check inside this tent yet?"

Teisha's face turns white. "Hurry, Jack!" she hisses, "Out the back way!"

Without pausing to think, you dive through the back flap.

Behind the Silk Tent
This is a cramped little square formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.

You can hear Teisha yelling shrilly at the mercenaries behind you - then her tirade is cut off abruptly amidst grunted curses. Someone is fumbling with the back flap of the tent!

>climb
You must supply a noun.

The mercenaries burst out of the tent. With nowhere to run, you are quickly overwhelmed. They drag you back out to the market (dimly you see Teisha sitting amidst her scattered silks, nursing a bloody nose) and hold you firmly while calling to their comrades.

The captain soon arrives, followed by two more of his men. They take your other arm as their leader smiles. "Good work, dims. Got ourselves a nice little commission with this one." And before you can react, he takes a sack of black cloth from his belt and jerks it down over your head.

Everything goes dark. You can't breathe. You struggle, but you can no more break the iron grip on your arms than you could uproot a tree. The men holding you curse. Dimly, you hear shouts from the crowd - someone protesting this rough treatment of a child.

"Don't worry, m'lady," laughs the mercenary leader. "We'll treat the little rat nice an' gentle. Like this, see?"

Something huge and heavy crashes into your head, and the rest of your senses are ripped away. Why they wanted you, you never awake to find out.

Top of the Post
Perched atop the high central post, you can look out over the whole market square. To the north, Lord's Road heads out of the city towards Lord's Keep. Commerce Street and the rest of the city beckon to the east. In every other direction the city is surrounded by rolling meadows and farmlands.

Four anchor cables stretch away in four directions: northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast.

One of the mercenaries tries to climb after you, but can't get more than a few feet up before sliding back. Looks like you're safe for the time being - but they're already heatedly discussing how to get you down, and there are only so many ways you can go from here.

>remove cloak

You take off your old gray cloak.

More mercenaries are squeezing into the tiny square behind Teisha's tent.

>put cloak on wire
Which do you mean, the green silk cloak or your old gray cloak?

>old
Which do you mean, the northwest cable, the southwest cable, the northeast cable or the southeast cable?

>southeast
You wrap one end of your old gray cloak around your hand, then squat down and sling the other end around the anchor cable. You give it a good, hard yank to test your grip. You take a deep breath. You try to convince your heartbeat to slow down, or at least continue its dreadful hammering in some part of your body other than your throat. You fail. Then, finally, you swing down under the wire and kick off into space.

The wind is exhilarating as you zip down the line. The ground rushes up at you with terrifying speed. your old gray cloak whizzes hotly against the rough wire, and you vaguely smell smoke, but your impromptu harness holds. Shouts ring out and fingers point as the mercenaries spot you and race to where they think you will land. Suddenly your feet hit dirt. You let go of your old gray cloak and tumble to the hard ground, knocking over a couple of shoppers before you roll to a stop. The next moment you are back on your feet, bruised and breathless.

Hat Stall
Hats of all styles and sizes hang from scores of wooden pegs, a forest of varied headgear. They have big, flop-brimmed traveling hats; small, leather workman's caps; wide sappans of woven straw from the Kozar delta; fancy, feathered hats for courtly balls; and even a few ordinary bonnets. More stalls lie to the north, northwest, west, and southwest.

You can see your old gray cloak here.

You hear shouting coming from all quarters of the market. If the mercenaries saw where you landed, they'll be after you in no time.

>take old cloak

The shouts are getting closer.

You hear curses and yells of pain as the mercenaries shove their way through the crowds of shoppers. They're closing in!

>wear silk cloak
You slip the silk cloak over your shoulders and pull the hood up. The fabric feels smooth and cool on your skin, but you don't have time to admire it now - you've got to run!

Someone yells, "There! I see him!"

You race through the crowd.

Eastern Junction
You're near the eastern edge of Grubber's Market. Commerce Street lies to the east. You can travel along the outer ring of stalls to the north or south, or head towards the market's central hub to the west.

You hear thudding footsteps right behind you!

>e
You reach the edge of the market just ahead of your pursuers and see the mercenary captain standing there. He hasn't seen the commotion yet; he's still casually scanning faces.

You skid to a halt. Everything depends on you looking like you're not in a hurry.

You force yourself to walk slow. Underneath the hood, sweat is pouring down your cheeks, and you can barely control your breathing. The shouts behind you are getting nearer. The captain is not looking at you, he's looking at the mercenaries pounding up behind you. Does he understand what they're shouting? Just a few more steps...

A bead of sweat rolls off the tip of your nose and drops to the ground, leaving a little dark spot in the dust. Did the captain notice?

Five steps... four steps... three steps...

You hear a confused babble of voices behind you as the captain orders his men to halt and explain what's going on.

You slip through the crowds into Commerce Street...

Chapter 2 - Bobby 

You made it.

You let out a long, shaky breath. You're safe now. Commerce Street is home to a slightly more upscale class of merchant, and business here is not quite as frantic as in Grubber's Market. Transactions tend to be calmer and more deliberate, and involve significantly more money. The Lord's Guard will be far less tolerant of a pack of armed bullies menacing the citizens of the upper class, so it's unlikely that the mercenaries will follow you here. And even if they did, there are too many streets and side alleys for them to block off your escape.

Gratefully, you remove the cloak, which was beginning to stick to your skin with all the sweat. Now it's time to pause, catch your breath, and try to figure out why they were after you in the first place.

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs east to west, between Grubber's Market and Lord's Market. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east.

Bakery
The air is heavy with the warm and slightly damp smell of freshly baked bread, and the counters are piled high with golden loaves, baguettes, and rolls. You can leave the bakery to the south.

A man dressed in flour-dusted baker's whites stands behind the counter, busily rolling out dough.

The man behind the counter nods at you amiably as you enter the shop.

>x baker
Germaise the Baker is a tall, thin man from the south. He has a thick accent and likes to stroke his sparse moustaches with his fingertips while he talks - the lower half of his face is almost always covered with a grayish coating of flour. He's a shameless flirt, always eyeballing the young ladies who come into his store. It's moments like those that make you grateful for your disguise. 

>talk to him
You lean casually on the counter, and the baker raises one flour-dusted eyebrow. "You want something?" he asks.

1. "How's business?"
2. "What have you got to sell today?"
3. "Do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market?"
4. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
5. "What do you think of the Queen?"
6. "What do you think of the Princess?"
7. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
8. "What did you think of the old Duke?"
9. "Nothing, never mind."

>1
"So how's business, Germaise?" you ask.

Germaise sighs. "I've had the ovens fired up night and day all week trying to fill a rush order for Baron Fossville. It's good for business, don't get me wrong, but..." He slaps dispiritedly at the dough, sending up a puff of flour. "You have to spend time on a pastry to make it just right. Breaks my heart to do slapdash work like this, but what can you do? The Baron wants quantity, not quality."

1. "What's the occasion for the pastries?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "One more question."

>1
"So what are all the pastries for?" you ask. Somehow, you never envisioned Fossville as someone who was particularly passionate about eating pastries.

Germaise shrugs. "Fossville should tell me his business? Maybe he just likes pastries. Maybe he's throwing a big party. All the more reason to take extra care over the pastries if that's the case, but what do I know? I'm just the baker."

1. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
2. "One more question."

>1
"What do you think of Baron Fossville?" you ask. "It sounds like you're not exactly pleased to be getting his custom."

"No, no, it's not that, not that at all," Germaise says hastily. "Fossville runs the city well and his taxes are fair. They say he has a temper, but who am I to judge? Now, the Duke before him..." he seems on the verge of saying something, but then thinks better of it. "Eh, well," he mutters, and attacks his dough with renewed vigor.

1. "What did you think of the old Duke?"
2. "One more question."

>1
"It's only been a couple of years since the old Duke died," you say. "Do you miss him?"

Germaise gets a faraway look in his eyes. "Ah, Duke Toresal," he mutters, "there was a bright and honorable Lord. He'd have been in line for the throne himself if he hadn't married below his station. And if he hadn't died." He sighs. "Eh, well. Those were better days, Jack."

1. "One more question."

>1
"You mind if I ask you something else?" you ask.

"As long as it doesn't slow down my pastries," Germaise replies.

1. "How's business?"
2. "What have you got to sell today?"
3. "Do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market?"
4. "What's the occasion for the pastries?"
5. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"

7. "What do you think of the Princess?"
8. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
9. "What did you think of the old Duke?"
10. "Nothing, never mind."

>2
Knowing that the question always puts him in a good mood, you ask, "What are you selling today, Germaise?"

A smile spreads across the baker's flour-streaked face. "What is it you desire?" he replies. "I have round breads and flat breads, grain breads and white breads, hard breads and soft breads, long loaves and demi-loaves. I make rolls, muffins, pastries, cakes, and the most delicious fried dough you will ever taste. It is no joke to say that my buns are the most firm and delicious in all of Toresal."

"So..." you say, trying to play it tricky, "you hear anything about mercenaries running around Grubber's?"

"Eh?" Germaise looks up, startled. "Mercenaries in Grubber's?"

"Oh yeah," you say. "I, uh, heard they were kicking over stalls, scaring the locals, really roughing up the place. I was just wondering if you knew anything about it?"

"Did they knock over Teisha's tent?" Germaise blurts out. "Is Teisha all right?"

1. "Yes, Teisha's fine."
2. "The mercenaries roughed Teisha up."

>1
There he goes again, you think, trying not to roll your eyes too obviously. "Yeah, uh, Teisha's just fine. She's great."

Germaise lets out a sigh of relief. "Ah good. Such a lovely girl, that Teisha. Such a firm girl. Maybe I'll send her a few pastries as a gift, so she knows I'm thinking about her..."

Germaise tosses another handful of flour onto the dough.

1. "One more question."

>1
"You mind if I ask you something else?" you ask.

"As long as it doesn't slow down my pastries," Germaise replies.

1. "How's business?"
2. "What have you got to sell today?"
3. "Do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market?"
4. "What's the occasion for the pastries?"
5. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
6. "What do you think of the Queen?"
7. "What do you think of the Princess?"
8. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
9. "What did you think of the old Duke?"
10. "Nothing, never mind."

>4
"I told you," says Germaise, "I don't know why he wants all the pastries. I suppose he's entertaining someone."

1. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
2. "One more question."

>1
"I told you already," says Germaise, "he's no worse than most."

1. "What did you think of the old Duke?"
2. "One more question."

>1
"I already told you," says Germaise, "he was a good man who died before his time."

Germaise works the dough, pounding and pushing it into shape.

1. "One more question."

>1
"You mind if I ask you something else?" you ask.

"As long as it doesn't slow down my pastries," Germaise replies.

1. "How's business?"
2. "What have you got to sell today?"

4. "What's the occasion for the pastries?"
5. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
6. "What do you think of the Queen?"
7. "What do you think of the Princess?"
8. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
9. "What did you think of the old Duke?"
10. "Nothing, never mind."

>6
"What do you think of the Queen?" you ask.

Germaise shrugs and makes a dismissive pfff noise, blowing a cloud of flour from his moustache. "I try not to. The King placed a greater value on looks than wisdom, and that is his royal prerogative, but then he went and died and the rest of us had to live with the consequences."

1. "What do you think of the Princess?"
2. "One more question."

>1
"What do you think of the Princess?" you ask.

Germaise shrugs. "I hear she's a pretty thing, like her mother once was. That plus the throne makes her quite the prize."

Germaise tosses another handful of flour onto the dough.

1. "What do you think of the Queen?"
2. "One more question."

>1
"I told you already," says Germaise, "she's a poor ruler at best, a Royal fool at worst."

Germaise cuts the dough into strips, twists the strips into a complicated shape, and slides the whole thing into the glowing mouth of the brick oven behind him. Then he slaps another mound of dough onto the counter and starts the process all over again.

1. "What do you think of the Princess?"
2. "One more question."

>2
"You mind if I ask you something else?" you ask.

"As long as it doesn't slow down my pastries," Germaise replies.

1. "How's business?"

4. "What's the occasion for the pastries?"

6. "What do you think of the Queen?"
7. "What do you think of the Princess?"
8. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
9. "What did you think of the old Duke?"
10. "Nothing, never mind."

>8
"It seems like the Ascension is all anyone talks about lately," you say. "What's the big deal, anyway?"

Germaise rolls his eyes and flaps his flour-white hands in the air. "Eh, a big how-do-you-do about nothing, believe me. The Ascension is when the throne is bestowed on the Queen's successor. Officially we common folk get some say in who that will be, but if you believe that, you're daft. Anyone with a dram of sense knows that the throne will go to the Queen's daughter, and to whoever is ruthless enough and lucky enough to wed her. Don't trouble your head about Royal politics, Jack," Germaise adds, giving his dough a vicious punch. "It's far above the likes of you and me."

1. "What do you think of the Queen?"
2. "What do you think of the Princess?"
3. "One more question."

>3
"You mind if I ask you something else?" you ask.

"As long as it doesn't slow down my pastries," Germaise replies.

Germaise peers into the oven, checking on the status of his latest batch.

1. "How's business?"
2. "What have you got to sell today?"
3. "Do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market?"
4. "What's the occasion for the pastries?"

"Oh, nothing," you say.

Germaise nods and goes back to his dough.

Germaise works the dough, pounding and pushing it into shape.

"Later, Germaise," you call out as you leave.

"Eh," grunts Germaise, flapping a flour-dusted hand at you.

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs east to west, between Grubber's Market and Lord's Market. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east. 

>n

Butcher's Shop
Chains of linked sausages and thick, red cuts of meat dangle from hooks in the ceiling, and trays of less identifiable bits sit out on the counters. It's better than some butcheries you've seen, but it's still not your favorite place in the city. You can leave to the south.

Old Man Holstenoffer is leaning over his huge, bloodstained butcher block behind the counter, hacking up some carcass.

Holstenoffer glances over his shoulder as you come in. "Ey, Jack!" he calls. "Long time, no see. Bobby was around this morning, looking for yeh. Up to something again, eh?" he laughs.

1. "What did Bobby want?"
2. "Heard any gossip?"
3. "What do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's?"
4. "Can I ask you something?"

>1
"Bobby was looking for me?" you ask, trying to contain your excitement. "Did he say what he wanted?"

Holstenoffer shrugs. "Didn't say. He said he'd be waiting for you over by Lord's Market. Yeh oughtta stick by Bobby more, Jack," he adds. "Big strong lad, he is; do a skinny boy like yerself good to learn from him."

"Say, Jack," says Holstenoffer suddenly, "I haven't seen Widow Shannon down this way in a few days. Everything all right at Maiden House?"

1. "She's fine; she's just been busy."
2. "I try to stay away from Maiden House."
3. "She's just not into you, Holstenoffer."

>1
"Oh, everything's fine at Maiden House," you say, while thinking to yourself, and boring as ever. "Widow Shannon's just been busy; she hasn't had time to do the shopping."

"Well, tell her I've been savin' some choice cuts for her next time she comes down here. Good meat, better than she'll get in Grubber's, and cheaper too. Those orphans need to eat healthy." He grins. "And I need to convince Widow Shannon that I'd make her a good husband."

1. "I try to stay away from Maiden House."
2. "She's just not into you, Holstenoffer."
3. "Can I ask you something?"

>2
You sigh. "You know, I've told you before, Widow Shannon isn't looking for a husband. It's nothing against you personally, I think she just likes devoting all her time to the orphans."

Holstenoffer just smiles. "Oh, I know, Jack, that's what she says. But old Holstenoffer knows a few tricks too, yeh know." He waves his cleaver in the air nonchalantly; a bit of bloody gristle dangles from the blade's tip. "You just get her down here, and let Holstenoffer work his charm."

You know from past experience that there's no use arguing with him about this, so you just smile and nod. "I'll let her know," you say.

1. "Can I ask you something?"

>1
"Mind if I ask you a question?" you say.

"Go right ahead," says Holstenoffer.

1. "What did Bobby want?"
2. "Heard any gossip?"
3. "What do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's?"
4. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
5. "What do you think of the Queen?"
6. "What do you think of the Princess?"
7. "What do you think of the Ascension?"
8. "What did you think of the old Duke?"
9. "Where did you get the tattoos?"
10. "Never mind."

>2
"So, heard any good gossip lately, Holstenoffer?" you ask.

"Well, the mercenaries in Grubber's have got everyone excited," Holstenoffer says, "but I expect they'll be old news by tomorrow. Aside from that, all anyone talks about is the upcoming Ascension, yeh know."

1. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
2. "What do you think of the Queen?"
3. "What do you think of the Princess?"
4. "What do you think of the Ascension?"
5. "Can I ask you something?"
6. "Thanks."

>1
"So what do you think of Baron Fossville?" you ask.

The butcher's face suddenly grows dark, and his cleaver thwacks into the wooden block. "Tell yeh the truth Jack, I laugh about it when I can, but the Baron's a rat and I'm not afraid to say it. He don't care about this city, he don't care for anything but his own purse and his own power, and he ain't half the lord the old Duke was. He and the old Duke were always at odds, yeh know. But Fossville won that quarrel, and not by playing fair, I'd wager." Holstenoffer shakes his cleaver menacingly. "It makes a man so angry, he's liable to cut his own hand off if he's not careful."

1. "What did you think of the old Duke?"
2. "Can I ask you something?"
3. "Thanks."

>1
"I guess you liked the old Duke better, huh?" you ask.

Holstenoffer takes a deep breath. "It's hard for someone your age to understand, Jack," he says. "Duke Toresal was a great man. A great, great man." He starts chopping furiously, as if trying to hide a sudden rush of emotion.

1. "Can I ask you something?"
2. "Thanks."

>1
"Mind if I ask you a question?" you say.

"Go right ahead," says Holstenoffer.

1. "What did Bobby want?"
2. "Heard any gossip?"
3. "What do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's?"
4. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
5. "What do you think of the Queen?"
6. "What do you think of the Princess?"
7. "What do you think of the Ascension?"
8. "What did you think of the old Duke?"
9. "Where did you get the tattoos?"
10. "Never mind."

>3
"Have you heard about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market this morning?" you ask.

Holstenoffer's eyes narrow. "All I know about mercs is, they're filthy scavengers to a man, with empty purses where their sense of honor oughtta be. Let 'em try coming up Commerce Street," he growls, tightening his grip on his cleaver, "They'll find more than some timid stallkeeper here!"

1. "Can I ask you something?"
2. "Thanks."

>1
"Mind if I ask you a question?" you say.

"Go right ahead," says Holstenoffer.

9. "Where did you get the tattoos?"
10. "Never mind."

>9
"Holstenoffer," you ask, "where did you get those tattoos?"

Holstenoffer looks proudly down at his arms. "Got these during my days at sea," he said. "I was quite the old salty dog, yeh know, before I came back to the city to be a meat chopper." Then he frowns. "Never did get the hang of it, though," he admits. "Kept gettin' seasick. Still, the tattoos are quite the conversation piece, they are."

1. "Can I ask you something?"
2. "Thanks."

"I told you already," says Old Man Holstenoffer, "you'll have to ask him yerself. He's somewhere around Lord's Market, east of here."

1. "Can I ask you something?"
2. "Thanks."

>2
"Thanks, Holstenoffer," you say.

"Always a pleasure," he says, bringing his cleaver down with a crunch.

>x tattoos
Holstenoffer's tattoos are a solid blue tangle of swirling designs, covering his arms from his wrists all the way up to his rolled-up sleeves.

Holstenoffer waves his bloody cleaver at you as you leave. "Take care of yourself, Jack."

Armory
The tangy smell of oiled steel is nearly overpowering in this small, windowless shop. All of the really interesting weapons - axes, flails, spiked gauntlets and the like - are high up on racks on the back wall, well behind the high counter. However, there is a display of assorted knives and daggers sitting out where you can get a close look at them.

Olgan Minor, the proprietor, leans against the counter, watching you intently.

>x olgan
Olgan Minor is short but muscular, with a lined face and graying, military-cut hair. He says nothing as you browse his wares, but his eyes seem to bore right into you. You are suddenly certain that he knows you're not really a boy - that he knew it the instant you walked into his shop. 

>talk to olgan
"Um, mind if I ask you something?" you stammer.

The man's lip twitches slightly, but he says nothing. You decide (foolishly, perhaps) to interpret this as a "yes".

Minor's eyes seem to drill right into you.

1. "Tell me about your weapons."
2. "What do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market?"
3. "Have you seen Bobby lately?"
4. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
5. "Never mind."

>1
You make a show of looking around the shop. "You sure have a lot of interesting weapons, here," you say. "Can you tell me something about them?"

"You should find something else to be interested in," Olgan sneers, "else you're likely to get cut."

1. "What do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market?"
2. "Have you seen Bobby lately?"
3. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
4. "Never mind."

>1
"Do you, uh, know anything about the mercenaries who were in Grubber's Market this morning?"

Olgan smiles unpleasantly. "They're some of my best customers. Should I let them know you were asking?"

"Er - no, no thanks," you stammer. "Not necessary."

1. "Tell me about your weapons."
2. "Have you seen Bobby lately?"
3. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
4. "Never mind."

>2
"I, uh, don't suppose you've seen Bobby around?" you ask. "Tall? Blonde hair?"

Olgan Minor just curls his lip with contempt.

1. "Tell me about your weapons."
2. "What do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market?"
3. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
4. "Never mind."

>3
"So what's your opinion on Baron Fossville?" you ask.

"I don't discuss politics with customers," Olgan snaps.

1. "Tell me about your weapons."
2. "What do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market?"
3. "Have you seen Bobby lately?"
4. "Never mind."

No such option.

2. "What do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market?"

"Uh, okay then," you mumble. "I'll just... look around by myself, then."

Minor trims his nails with a small knife. The whole time, he never stops staring at you. He never blinks.

>x weapons
The sheer variety of ways to grievously injure someone with a sharp, metal instrument leaves you both impressed and vaguely disturbed. 

>x knives
Over a dozen gleaming blades are set out in neat little rows: from long, wicked stilettos, to demure little stickers you could hide inside an opera glove, to gigantic cleavers that would make Holstenoffer next door jealous. 

Olgan Minor's constant staring is really starting to creep you out. You find yourself wishing you'd never entered his shop.

The blades are all beautiful, polished to a deadly gleam.

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

>x black gate
Black Gate Estate is the home of Baron Fossville, the current Lord of Toresal since the old Duke's death (though he has yet to be fully confirmed). It is a somber building of dark flagstone and slate, although you've heard the Baron keeps a beautiful rooftop garden. 

>x red gate
This is where the Duke and former Lord of Toresal lived, until his death several years ago. Now it stands empty, slowly crumbling. No one has ever made an attempt to claim the property, and the Baron seems content to let it remain vacant. The front gates are securely locked. 

>x jacobs
Jacobs the Elder is rumored to be the richest merchant in Toresal. His lavish city residence is built to resemble a miniature castle, complete with turrets, crenellations, and a heavy portcullis over the front door. 

>x turrets
All the castle-style architecture on Jacobs' mansion is a bit ostentatious. 

>x portcullis
All the castle-style architecture on Jacobs' mansion is a bit ostentatious. 

>x park
The park is a couple of acres of open meadow and sparse woods in the middle of the city, set aside by the previous Lord to promote health and relaxation among Toresal's citizens. It still sees strollers and the occasional picnicker by day, although it's become infamous as a haunt for cutpurses by night. The park is surrounded by a high stone wall, with a gate on the north side. 

>s
You hesitate. Several street kids have congregated in the middle of the park, chasing each other and playing at knights and villains in the late afternoon warmth. Some of them know you from Maiden House, and know that you're really a girl. That could lead to an awkward situation if one of them called you out in front of someone who only knows you as a boy. Especially if that someone was Bobby.

>e

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south. 

As you are standing there getting your bearings, the door to the moneylender's shop suddenly slams open. A tall, dark-cloaked figure storms out, shouting over his shoulder, "...regret refusing my business! I know import-OOF!" -and before you have a chance to react, he crashes into you. You both hit the cobbles in a tangle of limbs.

Muttering apologies, you try to disentangle yourself, but the man is on his feet in an instant, dragging you up by your elbow. "Why you insolent little cutpurse-"

A woman standing next to him places her hand on his shoulder. "Calm yourself, Fossville," she says. Only her chin is visible beneath the shadow of her hood, but the woman's voice is cool and commanding. "It's only a foolish street boy. You've already terrified him."

The man - you realize now that he must be Baron Fossville, Lord of the city since the old Duke died, and one of the most powerful nobles in Toresal - eyes you suspiciously. Even flustered, his sharp features are intense, handsome, and dangerously intelligent. His lips twitch slightly beneath his trim moustache. Finally, he releases you.

"Off with you then, urchin," he growls, flicking his fingers as though he had just touched something filthy. "Take your begging elsewhere, and learn to stay out from under the feet of your betters."

Fossville strides off towards Commerce Street, followed closely by his hooded companion. As she brushes past you, you can hear her talking in a low voice, "...have the money you need, but we must be subtle about it. The Queen can not appear to play favorites..."

And then they are gone.

A small bell above the door tinkles as you enter, and a man comes rushing out of the store's back room with a measuring cord in his hands, held up as though ready to begin fitting you immediately. When he sees that you're merely a boy (and by all appearances, not one with much in the way of discretionary income at that), he stops in his tracks and his expression grows distinctly pouty. He manages to keep most of the disappointment out of his voice as he asks, "May I help you?"

Royal Tunic
The walls are hung with tasteful curtains, and a deep, soft carpet covers the floor. Several clothier's dummies stand about the room, displaying gorgeous formal court apparel for both men and women. The street lies west.

The clothier stands nearby, eyeing you with some distaste.

>x clothier
Tall, thin, and impeccably dressed, although his fashion sense seems a bit...decorative, compared to the more austere look preferred by men of Toresal's upper class. His hairline is receding, and what hair he has left is plastered back onto his scalp with fragrant oil. He looks as though he'd secretly prefer to wipe things down with a scented handkerchief before touching them; somehow, through good breeding and intestinal fortitude, he manages to soldier on despite not doing so. 

>talk to him
The clothier sniffs and pretends not to hear you.

>out
"Come back soon, sweetie," calls the clothier as you leave.

Sandler & Sons Jeweler
The inside of this store is tasteful but austerely decorated, perhaps to better draw the eye towards the glass display case in the center of the room and the king's ransom in jewelry contained therein. You can leave to the west.

Pieter stands discreetly near the back of the room.

Dame Sandler's eyebrows raise slightly as you walk into her store. "Well, hello there, Squire Jack," she says, in her typically smooth (and the slightest bit mocking) tone. "We haven't had the pleasure of your company in a while. You look a bit out of breath - nothing ails you, I hope?"

1. "No, I'm fine."
2. "There were mercenaries chasing me this morning."

>2
"There were mercenaries chasing me all over Grubber's Market this morning," you admit. "I guess I'm still a bit shaken up."

"Ah yes, I did hear about that nasty business in Grubber's Market," Dame Sandler says. "How terrible. Odd, the way they seemed so interested in you."

1. "What do you mean, 'odd'?"
2. "I don't know what you're talking about."

>1
"What do you mean, 'odd'?" you ask.

"Only that there seems to be no conceivable reason for a group of trained soldiers to be hunting for an orphan of no significant heritage. Questions spring to mind, such as: who hired them? And why now in particular? And is everything about this incident what it seems to be?"

Dame Sandler smiles at you. She doesn't seem to be actually asking you these questions, so much as hinting to you that she already knows the answers.

1. "I don't know what you're talking about."

>1
Suddenly Dame Sandler's knowing tone starts to seem a little bit creepy. "I don't know what you're talking about," you say, cautiously. "Those mercenaries chasing me were just a coincidence."

Dame Sandler smiles. "Of course they were, my dear Jack. Of course they were."

1. "Have you seen Bobby?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you think of the Queen?"
4. "What do you think of the Princess?"
5. "What do you know about the Ascension?"

>1
"Have you seen Bobby around?" you ask, trying to make it sound casual.

"Ah, Bobby," says Dame Sandler with a knowing smile. "Now there's a boy who could get you into all sorts of the most... interesting sorts of trouble. Why yes," she adds. "I have seen him. He was wandering around the south end of the square, just by the alley."

1. "Thanks! I should go."
2. "Can I ask you something?"

>2
"Can I ask you a question, Dame Sandler?" you ask.

"But of course, my dear Jack," she says.

1. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
2. "What do you think of the Queen?"
3. "What do you think of the Princess?"
4. "What do you know about the Ascension?"

>1
"What do you think of  Baron Fossville?" you ask.

Dame Sandler smirks. "Fossville is a buffoon, of course, but he is a buffoon with the backing of some very powerful people and a large number of hired swords. He's not one to trifle with lightly. Of course, I never do anything lightly," she adds, smiling enigmatically.

1. "What do you think of the Queen?"
2. "What do you think of the Princess?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"

>1
"What do you think of the Queen?" you ask.

"The Queen may be a poor ruler," Dame Sandler says, "but she is a shrewd politician. She backs Fossville for now, but she will snip him off like a loose thread if she deems it advantageous."

1. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
2. "What do you think of the Princess?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"

>2
"What do you think of the Princess?" you ask.

Dame Sandler shrugs. "The Princess has as much riding on the Ascension as Fossville does," she says. "Can you blame her? This is her chance to become Queen of Miradania, after all. If you had that sort of opportunity, wouldn't you do anything in your power to grasp it?" And she smiles again, strangely.

1. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
2. "What do you think of the Queen?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"

>3
"What do you know about the Ascension?" you ask.

Dame Sandler merely arches one eyebrow and smiles at you. "Why, what do you think about it, Jack?"

1. "I don't know anything about it."
2. "It seems like it's going to fall to the Princess."
3. "Why should I care?"

>2
"It seems like a done deal, from what I've heard," you say. "The Princess will take the throne, and I guess Baron Fossville if she consents to marry him."

Dame Sandler shakes her head. "It's never a 'done deal', Jack, not until the crown is finally placed on someone's head - and sometimes not even then. The throne is the greatest prize in all the kingdom, and no one with any stake in it can afford to let it be a forgone conclusion."

She smiles in that knowing way of hers. "Some friendly advice, Jack: the Ascension is the most important event you will witness in your lifetime. It would behoove you to understand more about it. You should ask around; you might be surprised at some of the answers you get."

1. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
2. "What do you think of the Queen?"
3. "What do you think of the Princess?"

>3
"Like I said," says Dame Sandler, "the Princess wants her chance to be Queen. Just as I imagine any girl of her age and position would."

1. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
2. "What do you think of the Queen?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"

>1
"I already told you," says Dame Sandler, "Fossville is a powerful man and not one to be trifled with, whatever your opinions of him."

1. "What do you think of the Queen?"
2. "What do you think of the Princess?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south. 

>s

Back Alley
A little-known shortcut between Lord's Market and the less affluent neighborhoods of the city's south end. A narrow street to the southwest leads to Maiden House, or you can return to the market square to the north.

At the end of the alley, a group of young urchins - none older than their eighth year - are clustered around something. As you draw closer, you see Bobby crouched in the midst of them. He's holding his arm out, his fist loosely clenched in front of a dirty-cheeked child of six.

"Go on," says Bobby. "Go on, take a look."

The little boy, his eyes wide and solemn, reaches out and pries Bobby's fingers open. His hand is empty. The little boy looks dismayed.

"Ah, but what's this?" asks Bobby. And he reaches forward and draws a copper coin from behind the boy's grimy ear. There is a collective gasp and squeals of delight from the rest of the children. The little boy's eyes look ready to fall out of his head.

Bobby presses the coin into the little boy's hand, then passes out more coins to the others. "Here," he says, "keep it safe in your pocket. Spend it on bread, not candy." The children take their prizes and scatter.

Bobby stands and stretches, then sees you. The corner of his mouth goes up in that lop-sided grin you know so well. "'Lo, Jack,' he says. "What's happening?"

1. "Nothing much."
2. "I was chased by some mercenaries."

>1
"Oh, nothing much," you say. "Just, you know... doing stuff. Around the city. Staying tricky."

"Huh," says Bobby, nodding vaguely.

Goddesses, you think to yourself, I am such a dim!

You realize you're staring, and quickly find something else to look at. Goddesses, but he's handsome.

1. "What did you want to see me for?"
2. "Can I ask you a question?"

>1
"So, I heard you were looking for me," you say. "What'd you want to tell me?"

Bobby grins.

He makes a show of looking carefully over one shoulder, then the other, then leans close to whisper. "I found this new place, right? It's a big secret, extra tricky. I was thinking of doing a bit of exploring there later tonight. You want to come with?" He smiles that knowing half-smile of his, the one that always means he's about to do something that will be very fun, or land you both in a pile of trouble, or - the usual case - both.

Bobby whistles a few notes of some popular mummer's tune.

1. "Where is this place?"
2. "I'm in."

>1
"I don't know," you say. "Where is this place?"

Bobby rolls his eyes. "Well, that's kind of the point. If I told you, it would ruin the secret. C'mon, Jack, are you in or out?"

You realize you're staring, and quickly find something else to look at. Goddesses, but he's handsome.

1. "I'm in."

>1
Could you even consider saying no? "Okay, let's do it," you say, your heart thumping hard. "I'm in."

"You're a good bloke, Jack," says Bobby. "Now, you don't want the Widows worrying about you, so head on home for now. Once it gets dark, sneak back out and meet me in the Grubber's Market. Right? Good. See you later, Jack." He claps his hand on your shoulder, then turns and strides, all grace and overconfidence, out of the alley.

Entrance to Maiden House
The alley dead-ends in a small courtyard surrounded by old, run-down buildings. You can return to the main part of the city to the northeast.

A battered wooden door provides entrance into the southern building. There's no sign, but you know it well nonetheless - this is the door to Maiden House, your "home".

>x maiden house
There's nothing on the outside to distinguish Maiden House from any of the other run-down tenements in this neighborhood, but you recognize it well. You grew up in this place, and it is filled with memories both good and bad. Well, okay, mostly bad. But you make do with what you have.

>knock on door
Knock knock. There is no reply.

>open door
That's already open.

>s
You slip quietly through the front door, into the familiar smells of cooking grease and laundry soap; the familiar sight of shabby, warped floorboards lit by dim, flickering tallow lamps. It's nothing fancy, but it's home, and you're familiar enough with the plight of most of Toresal's orphans to know that you're lucky to have it.

Hallway
The main hallway runs through the center of Maiden House, with several doorways leading to rooms on either side. To the southeast and southwest are the laundry and privy, respectively; to the northeast lies the kitchen; and to the northwest is the dormitory where you and the other orphans sleep.

The front door is open.

Widow Theresa, who probably has been lurking here all day, just waiting for you to return, springs out from her corner and slams the front door shut. "The evening churchbells are ringing, Jacqueline," she tells you, her mouth set in a satisfied little line. "Well past the time when any respectable young lady should be out on the streets." She locks the door with a long brass key that she wears on a ribbon around her neck.

Widow Theresa turns to you. "You're filthy," she says, "though no more than usual. I realize it's too much to ask you to actually do any of your chores, but you might at least like to wash yourself, if only in consideration for the next poor girl who has to wash your sheets."

1. "And how are you this evening?"
2. "You can't lock me in!"
3. "Give me a break, I was chased by mercenaries this morning."

>1
"And how are you this fine evening, Widow Theresa?" you say, dropping an exaggerated curtsey.

Her face twitches. "I'll not be baited by the simple sarcasm of a spoiled brat," she says. "Go find someone else to bother."

1. "Where are Fiona and Shannon?"
2. "Let me ask you something."

>1
You sigh. The last thing you need is to get drawn into another argument with Widow Theresa. "Where are Widow Fiona and Widow Shannon?" you ask.

"Fiona is in the kitchen, washing the dishes," she says, "and Shannon is in the laundry room. Which is to say, they are actually doing something productive, so you'll avoid them at all costs, I'm sure."

1. "Let me ask you something."

>1
"Let me ask you something," you say.

Widow Theresa does not answer at first, but after a moment she glares at you sharply and says, "What?"

1. "What do you think of Widow Fiona?"
2. "What do you think of Widow Shannon?"
3. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
4. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
5. "What do you know about my parents?"

>1
"What do you think of Widow Fiona?" you ask.

Theresa looks at you for a long time before answering. "I think," she says, finally, "that playing favorites does an injustice to the other children here, but in your case it's even worse because of how little you deserve it. Fiona thinks you're something special. But I think you're just a spoiled brat who thinks she can get away with whatever she likes. And I think that one day, you're going to be caught with your fingers in the wrong pocket, and then you will be very, very sorry." She sneers and adds in a low voice, "And I think I'm looking forward to that day."

1. "What do you think of Widow Shannon?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
4. "What do you know about my parents?"

>1
"What do you think of Widow Shannon?" you ask.

"Shannon?" laughs Theresa. "I'd say she's too dim to catch another husband, but I'm not sure she even wants one. Don't worry, she'll still be here long after you're dead in a gutter somewhere."

1. "What do you think of Widow Fiona?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
4. "What do you know about my parents?"

>2
"What do you think of Baron Fossville?" you ask.

Widow Theresa gets a wistful look in her eye. "Baron Fossville is a great man. A great and... handsome man." Her look hardens. "It pains me to hear his name coming from your dirty little liar's mouth."

1. "What do you think of Widow Fiona?"
2. "What do you think of Widow Shannon?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
4. "What do you know about my parents?"

>3
"What do you know about the Ascension?" you ask.

Widow Theresa sniffs. "Royal politics are for people of breeding and intellect, which puts it far above your concern, I'm sure."

1. "What do you think of Widow Fiona?"
2. "What do you think of Widow Shannon?"
3. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
4. "What do you know about my parents?"

>4
"Widow Theresa," you say suddenly, "what do you know about my parents?" You're not quite sure why you asked the question; it's certainly never occurred to you to ask her before.

But as soon as the words leave your mouth, you realize your mistake. Widow Theresa would never let such a rich opportunity to hurt you pass unseized.

"I don't know much," she says, "but I can make an educated guess. No doubt your father was some vagrant, probably on the run from the law. Too shifty to stay around for you, at any rate. As for your mother," she goes on with a cruel smile, "no one knows who she was, nor is anyone likely to ever learn. But women like that all tend to end up in the same place in the end, don't they?"

Your face is alternating burning hot and icy cold, and your fists are clenched to keep your hands from shaking. "Well. Thanks," you manage to whisper.

Kitchen
A low-ceilinged room with a fire pit at one end for cooking, a basin at the other end for washing, and rows upon rows of pots and pans hanging from the rafters. The long table at the side of the room is where the children take their meals. You can leave to the southwest.

Widow Fiona is here, washing the last of the dinner dishes.

Fiona looks over her shoulder as you enter the kitchen. "Good evening, Jacqueline. And how has the day treated you?"

1. "Oh, fine."
2. "I was chased by mercenaries."
3. "I saw Bobby on the way home."
4. "Widow Theresa locked me in!"

>* Ah, good; now Fiona is in place
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>2
"It's been kind of crazy, to tell the truth," you say. "There were armed mercenaries chasing me through Grubber's Market this morning."

"What?" Widow Fiona drops her dishes and rushes over to you. "Oh, Goddesses, Jacqueline, are you hurt?"

1. "Nah, I'm fine."
2. "A few bumps and scratches is all."

>1
"Nah, it was tricky," you say, feigning an insouciance that you don't really feel. "Just a lot of people running around and yelling about nothing."

Widow Fiona doesn't seem convinced, however. She checks you all over for injuries, muttering "Goddesses... so close... could have been... all because of..." Finally, after she's satisfied that you aren't secretly bleeding to death, she looks you directly in the eye. "Listen, Jacqueline, I'm glad you're all right, but I think it would be a good idea to stay off the streets for a while. Especially Grubber's Market. We'll send Shannon if we need any groceries."

1. "Why are you so worried?"
2. "Yes ma'am."

>1
Even though she's trying to hide it, you've never seen Widow Fiona so upset. "Why are you so worried?" you ask. "Do you know something about those men?"

She looks away, goes back to the basin and starts clattering dishes around. "No... no. I'm just so relieved that you're not hurt. Please, Jacqueline, promise me you'll stay away from Grubber's Market."

1. "Yes ma'am."

>1
"Yes, ma'am, I will," you say. You know it's a promise you can't possibly keep, but you also know it will comfort Fiona to hear it.

She takes a deep breath. "Thank you, Jacqueline."

Widow Fiona leans away from the basin, stretching her back. "How about you help me with some of these dishes, Jacqueline?" she asks.

1. "Okay."
2. "I'll pass."

>1
"Okay," you say. You start stacking the dry dishes as Fiona washes them.

"Thank you. You are a dear one," she says.

1. "Can I ask you a question?"

>1
"Do you mind if I ask you a question?" you ask.

"Of course not, dear," Widow Fiona says.

1. "What do you think of Widow Theresa?"
2. "What do you think of Widow Shannon?"
3. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
4. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
5. "What do you know about my parents?"

>1
"What do you think of Widow Theresa?" you ask, trying to keep the angry edge out of your voice.

"Widow Theresa can be prickly at times," Fiona says, keeping her voice carefully neutral, "but you must be patient with her. She's had a difficult life. Her late husband left her with a heavy debt, and she's never been able to forgive him for that."

1. "What do you think of Widow Shannon?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
4. "What do you know about my parents?"

>1
"What do you think of Widow Shannon?" you ask.

"Oh, Shannon's a sweet one," Fiona says. "Don't ever make the mistake of thinking her simple. She's here because she loves the children, and that's all she needs."

Widow Fiona wipes a plate dry on her apron and stacks it on the counter.

1. "What do you think of Widow Theresa?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
4. "What do you know about my parents?"

>2
"What do you think of Baron Fossville?" you ask.

Widow Fiona's expression hardens, which is not something that happens often. "Fossville is a very ambitious man," she says. "And ambitious men tend to be dangerous to those around them, whether they mean to be or not. You shouldn't concern yourself with him, Jacqueline."

1. "What do you think of Widow Theresa?"
2. "What do you think of Widow Shannon?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
4. "What do you know about my parents?"

>3
"What do you know about the Ascension?" you ask.

Fiona gives you an odd look. "The Ascension?" she asks. "What makes you ask?"

You shrug. "It's just that I keep hearing about it. Everyone's talking about it, and everyone has a different opinion about it, and it seems terribly important, but I still don't understand it very much."

She thinks for a moment, then says, "The reason why everyone is talking about the Ascension is because it's the first time we've had one in a long time. There's no clear successor to the throne, and so everyone is in a tizzy about who has a solid claim and who will be chosen. Probably we'll have a People's Regent, and when the time comes I'll make my voice heard along with everyone else... but the truth is, Jacqueline, is that even with the Regent, people like you and me have very little say in what happens."

1. "What do you think of Widow Theresa?"
2. "What do you think of Widow Shannon?"
3. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
4. "What do you know about my parents?"

>4
"Can you tell me anything about my parents?" you ask.

Fiona looks at you, surprised. "What brought that question on?"

"I don't really know," you say, which for once is the unvarnished truth. "I've just been thinking about them lately."

She dries her hands off and puts a hand on your shoulder. "We've told you before, your mother came to us and stayed only long enough to leave you on our doorstep. No one knows where she is now. As for your father..." She hesitates. "The only thing I can tell you with absolute certainty is that he loved you very much. Your parents weren't bad people, Jacqueline, they were put in a hard circumstance and had to make a terrible sacrifice. You were never unwanted. Just... unfortunate."

1. "What do you think of Widow Theresa?"
2. "What do you think of Widow Shannon?"
3. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
4. "What do you know about the Ascension?"

"Like I said," says Widow Fiona, "it's a very important ceremony that only very important people have a say in."

The kids are mostly younger than you. Some of them you saw earlier with Bobby.

It almost makes you wish you could be that young again. Your life was so much less complicated then.

Widow Theresa is a harsh, sour-faced woman, with suspicious eyes and a mannish, angular jaw that she thrusts out when she is angry, which is nearly always. You gather that she was very poor before coming to Maiden House, and she harbors a bitter dislike for anyone whom she perceives as unjustly privileged. For reasons that persistently escape you, that includes you. Staying out of her way is generally the best tactic.

You sneak a furtive glance back at the hallway, then step up onto the bench. It wobbles under your feet, and you grab the window sill to steady yourself.

Then, holding your breath to keep from making a sound, you pull yourself up and through. The window is at ground level outside, and you wriggle out onto the slick cobblestones.

You're free! Of course, the widows will find out you're gone soon enough - Maiden House is not a very big place, after all. But you've snuck out before, and they know you can take care of yourself. At worst, you'll pull extra laundry duty for a few days.

Laundry
The air in here is filled with steam and the sharp stink of lye soap. Moisture trickles down the walls, and puddles of water splash underfoot. The main hallway lies northwest.

Widow Shannon is bent over the big washtub in the corner, scrubbing out the toddlers' nappies.

Widow Shannon looks over her shoulder and gives you a friendly nod. "Hello, Miss Jacqueline," she says.

1. "Hello, Widow Shannon."
2. "You need a hand with the washing?"

"You need a hand with the washing?" you ask.

"No, no," Shannon says happily. "It's my day for it, anyway."

You breathe an inward sigh of relief. You were trying to be polite, but not that polite.

1. "Can you unlock the front door?"
2. "Can I ask you a question?"

"Widow Shannon," you say, picking your words carefully, "I was wondering... do you think you could open the front door for me, so I can go out? I know the bells have rung, but just this once? Please?"

Shannon frowns. "Widow Theresa's got the only key," she says. "What do you want to go out for?"

1. "Oh, nothing."
2. "I'm meeting Bobby later tonight."

>2
"I'm supposed to meet Bobby later tonight," you tell her.

Shannon laughs and gives you a knowing wink. "Oh, it's Bobby, is it? He is a cute one." She shakes her head. "I'm sorry, Miss Jacqueline, but curfew is curfew. Widow Theresa wouldn't give me the key if I asked, and even if she did, I'd not relish being on her waspish side if I were to let you out. However..." she adds, in an innocent-sounding voice, "if a clever girl like you were to find some way around the obstacles to make her midnight tryst, I'm sure I'd never notice a thing."

1. "Can I ask you a question?"

>1
"Can I ask you a question?" you ask.

"Of course, Miss Jacqueline," says Shannon.

4. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
5. "What do you know about my parents?"

"What do you think of Widow Theresa?" you ask.

Widow Shannon scrunches up her nose and starts scrubbing the clothes harder when you mention Theresa. "Well," she says, "it's important to obey your elders, Jacqueline. I'm sure Widow Theresa has your best interests in her heart."

1. "What do you think of Widow Fiona?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
4. "What do you know about my parents?"

2. "What do you think of Widow Fiona?"
3. "What do you know about the Ascension?"
4. "What do you know about my parents?"

>3

"The Ascension?" Shannon laughs. "Goddesses, Miss Jacqueline, where's your head been today? That Royal politics is far above the likes of me. I keep my feet on the ground, and my hands in the washing, where they belong."

1. "What do you think of Widow Theresa?"
2. "What do you think of Widow Fiona?"
3. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
4. "What do you know about my parents?"

>4
"Widow Shannon, did you ever know my parents?"

"Why, your mother was a beautiful woman," she says immediately. "And your father was a great man." This is what Widow Shannon says every time you ask about your parents; you're pretty sure that she never saw either one of them in her life.

1. "What do you think of Widow Theresa?"
2. "What do you think of Widow Fiona?"

Laundry
The air in here is filled with steam and the sharp stink of lye soap. Moisture trickles down the walls, and puddles of water splash underfoot. The main hallway lies northwest.

Widow Shannon is bent over the big washtub in the corner, scrubbing out the toddlers' nappies.

>smell
The harsh soap the widows like to use has a strong smell that burns your nostrils.

Hallway
The main hallway runs through the center of Maiden House, with several doorways leading to rooms on either side. To the southeast and southwest are the laundry and privy, respectively; to the northeast lies the kitchen; and to the northwest is the dormitory where you and the other orphans sleep.

The front door is closed.

Widow Theresa stalks the hallway, her eye out for trouble.

>stand on bench

>climb through window
You sneak a furtive glance back at the hallway, then step up onto the bench. It wobbles under your feet, and you grab the window sill to steady yourself.

Then, holding your breath to keep from making a sound, you pull yourself up and through. The window is at ground level outside, and you wriggle out onto the slick cobblestones.

You're free! Of course, the widows will find out you're gone soon enough - Maiden House is not a very big place, after all. But you've snuck out before, and they know you can take care of yourself. At worst, you'll pull extra laundry duty for a few days.

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

Grubber's Market
At night, the normally crowded marketplace is an empty maze of shadows, abandoned stalls and rolled-up canvas. The Lord's Road lies north, and Commerce Street lies back east.

Bobby is standing in the middle of Grubber's Market, under the shadow of the center post. 

When you get closer, he walks over and claps you on the shoulder. "Had a spot of trouble getting away from the Widows, eh, Jack?" he whispers.

1. "Not really."
2. "I had to sneak out."

>1
You shrug and say, "Not really."

Bobby raises his eyebrows. "All right, then."

You find yourself wishing you had made up some story about a daring, sneaky escape, so that Bobby would be more impressed.

"Okay then, we're ready to go," says Bobby. "We're off to the wood outside Lord's Keep; that place I wanted to show you is there. Now follow me, keep your hood up and your head down, and land your feet soft."

Without waiting for you to answer, Bobby heads north, out the city gates.

>x bobby

>follow bobby


Lord's Road
The wide and well-paved Lord's Road runs from Grubber's Market straight north to Lord's Keep, a mile or so from the city. To the east are rolling pastures; to the west, broken ground and scrub.

Bobby jerks his thumb down the road, to the north. "This road leads straight to the front gate of Lord's Keep; we want to stay away from there. I know a better way," he says with a knowing smile, and strikes off towards the open field to the east.

>x bobby
You can't see any such thing.

>follow bobby


Pasture
This wide, open field is used by the city for tourneys and other holiday events, or by cattle-sellers driving their livestock to market. Tonight it is empty except for the occasional cow pie. To the north you can see the dark, rough edge of a forest.

You feel nervous and exposed out here in all this empty space; you're more used to the narrow alleys and enclosing walls of the city. The urge to hunch over and make yourself small is near-irresistible.

Bobby, meanwhile, strides out into the middle of the moonlit field, standing straight and swinging his arms wide. "Fresh air, Jack!" he calls out, laughing. "Enjoy it! Take a deep breath!" He heads north, still laughing.

>x cow pie
Last time you checked, cow pies pretty much all looked the same. 

>smell it
Mostly you smell cow pies.

>enter forest

Stream Crossing
A small stream bubbles out of the woods and cuts through the pasture's north end. The edge of the forest lies to the north, just across the water. The city is far away to the south.

Bobby hops nimbly across, bouncing from rock to rock as though he were playing a game of Circles-and-Stones in the park. He doesn't get so much as the hem of his cloak damp. When he gets to the opposite bank, he turns and beckons you to follow before disappearing into the shadowy woods.

>follow bobby

The first couple of rocks are easy enough, but the third one wobbles when you put your weight on it. You end up pinwheeling your arms desperately, contorting yourself in every direction to avoid a tumble and a thorough soaking. Finally, with arms outstretched and lower lip clamped between your teeth, you pick your way across the remainder of the stream with all the grace of a drunkard on a greased tightrope.

At the edge of the woods, Bobby is nearly doubled over with silent laughter. He claps you on the back. "You're a good sport, Jack," he says. "C'mon, we're nearly there."


Woods
You are in the woodlands just southeast of Lord's Keep, following the game trails that wind their way through strands of pale birch and black spruce. There is just enough moonlight trickling through the upper branches to see your way by.

Bobby motions you over to where he's standing, pushing back the underbrush. "Look here, Jack," he says. "These trails go every which way, and it's easy to get lost. But if you keep an eye out for this one sapling," - he points to a small tree split halfway down its length - "...you'll find the right trail." He heads off through the trees to the west.

>x trees
The trees grow thick and close all around you. 

>x small split stree
You can't see any such thing.

>** I can, and it's a significant landmark
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

Clearing
The woods open out here in a small, moonlit clearing. The ruins of an old pavilion lie here, pale pavestones poking up like bones from the grass.

In the center of the clearing stands a crumbling fountain, topped by a cracked statue of the Goddess Brigid. One side of the stone plinth supporting the statue has opened up, revealing a narrow opening into darkness.

"Here we are." Bobby jumps up into the bowl of the fountain, dried leaves crackling beneath his boots. Then he reaches around the statue of Brigid as though trying to embrace her. His hands fumble at something on the underside of the urn.

Suddenly there is a deep, solid thunk and a scraping sound, and part of the base of the statue moves.

Bobby hops down and pushes against the statue's base. A rectangle of stone about two feet square swings inward. The space behind it is utterly black, and a cold draft of damp-smelling air rises out of it.

"It runs all the way to Lord's Keep," says Bobby as he brushes off his hands. "I don't think anyone knows about it. Maybe Lord Toresal did, but now that he's dead it's basically unknown. It's not been used for decades, I'd guess. Well anyway, until now."

He holds out his hand. His lop-sided smile is absolutely charming. "After you, kind sir."

>x bobby
Bobby's eyes dart towards every shadow, and he pauses often to listen for some noise you can't hear. But when he glances at you, his eyes still twinkle with his happy-go-lucky spirit, and he smirks as though nothing could possibly go wrong. 

>x brigid
The statue's features are worn away and obscured by moss, but you've seen enough statues of Brigid to know that she's almost always depicted carrying water. She cradles her urn like a child, tipping it gently over the bowl of the fountain. One side of the stone plinth supporting the statue is open, revealing a narrow tunnel leading down into darkness. 

>x urn
The urn is hollow, and probably had water flowing out of it when the fountain worked.

Looking closely, you notice a small metal bolt sticking out of the bottom of the urn. 

>x small metal bolt

>** Yes I can

Clearing
The woods open out here in a small, moonlit clearing. The ruins of an old pavilion lie here, pale pavestones poking up like bones from the grass.

Bobby is here, waiting for you. 

In the center of the clearing stands a crumbling fountain, topped by a cracked statue of the Goddess Brigid. One side of the stone plinth supporting the statue has opened up, revealing a narrow opening into darkness.

>* Good, the opening is now clearly mentioned
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x narrow opening
The tunnel leads down into darkness. 

>enter tunnel
You grope your way down into the tunnel, carefully sliding your feet over steps you cannot see. Echoes fill the darkness: the scrape of your shoes on stone, the drip of water, your own loud breathing.

Behind you, you hear Bobby fumbling with something under his cloak; the click of stone on metal; and then a sickly orange glow spreads across the walls of the tunnel. Your own shadow wobbles hugely in front of you.

You turn around and see Bobby holding a torch. He grins at you. "Tricky, isn't it?"

Underneath The Fountain
The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.

>x fungus
The fungus grows in little clusters all over the damp walls. 

>eat it
(first taking the floor)
That's hardly portable.

>eat fungus
(first taking the white fungus)
Just the thought of touching the sticky fungus makes you shudder.

>x steps
The stairs lead back up to the clearing above. 

>climb steps
You definitely can't chicken out now, not while Bobby is right here.

>n
Ducking your head to avoid the low ceiling, you follow the tunnel for some distance.


Tunnel End
The tunnel ends here at a blank, stone wall.

Bobby steps past you and brushes his fingertips across the stonework, holding the torch close. Eventually he finds a loose brick and pulls it free, revealing a rough, rectangular hole.

You wonder how many times Bobby has been down here. He exudes such easy confidence as he reaches into the hole, as though he has done this many times before.

There is a click. Bobby looks over his shoulder at you and winks. And then the north wall swings away, revealing shadowed spaces beyond.

>listen
You keep your ears pricked.

>smell
You smell nothing unexpected.

>n
Bobby jams his torch into a rusted bracket on the tunnel wall and steps through the secret door, gesturing you to follow. A prickle runs down your back as you step through after him. Are you really sneaking into the Lord's Keep? You're not even sure what the punishment for that is... something a lot worse than a few days in jail, certainly.

Chapel
The chapel of the Goddesses is a spacious, octagonal room, empty of furniture. The wood-paneled walls glow warmly, reflecting the light from dozens of devotional candles; the high ceiling disappears in the shadows overhead. A corridor leads southwest, and a secret passage in the south wall leads into subterranean gloom.

>x candles
The candles sit on little shelves built into the otherwise bare walls. It is traditional to light a candle when offering a prayer to one of the Goddesses; each of these wavering points of light is someone's hope, a wish, a dream. 

>x south wall
You can't see any such thing.

>x ceiling
You see nothing special about the ceiling.

>s
"Come on," Bobby whispers, pulling at your arm, "You don't want to go yet, we just got here. Let's explore some more." His eyes twinkle, and he gives you that smile that always says, trust me this will be fun, but usually means, if running pell-mell for safety with your heart in your throat and the Lord's Guard on your heels is your idea of "fun".

>sw

Lower Bailey
A thick wedge of shadow falls across the courtyard at the base of the Keep's outer wall, providing a relatively safe place to hide. The rest of the courtyard is flooded with moonlight, and bored-looking guards stroll back and forth over the gravel. You can enter another part of the castle to the northeast.

Bobby moves up quietly behind you. He puts his mouth very, very close to your ear and whispers, "Up there," pointing to the steps leading up to the top of the wall.

>x wall

Upper Bailey
At the top of the wall you can lean out over the parapets and take in all the lands surrounding Toresal. It's a nice view, but torches set every few yards along the wall make this a dangerous spot to linger in. Stairs lead down into the courtyard below, and a dark archway opens to the north.

Bobby comes up the steps right behind you and crouches against the wall. After a quick look around to make sure the coast is clear, he nods towards the archway to the north.

>x torches

Through the archway you can make out some sort of guardhouse.

Guardhouse
A narrow antechamber, with an open archway to the south and an iron-reinforced door to the north. Arrow slits to either side lend the door an important and dangerous air.

Bobby creeps forward and presses himself against the wall next to one of the arrow slits. He hunches closer, peering around the slit's edge. Then he looks up at you and smiles. He points at you, points at the arrow slit, then taps his ear. Listen, he's telling you.

>x arrow slits
The arrow slits are rectangular holes in the wall, about two inches high and six inches wide. Someone on the inside could stick the end of a crossbow in there and fire at anyone out here, all the while being totally protected by the wall. Fortunately, no one is manning the slits right now.

From here, you can see flickering firelight through the arrow slit, and hear voices on the other side. 

>listen
You can hear several voices coming from the room on the other side of the arrow slit - guards relaxing on break, probably.

"...and I says, I don't care who hired you, people are tryin' to do honest business here, and you're steppin' on toes. Take yer men and hit the road, or else you can continue searchin' for yer urchin boy in the city jail. And this tough fellow, him so hard with his sword and his scars and all, he just starts to cry, blubberin' like a frightened scullery maid!"

"Haw! Yer lyin', so you are!"

"Goddesses witness it, 'tis the truth! I could hardly credit it meself, and I weren't that impressed with the man to begin with. Go on, I says, and gave him a boot to the fundament to send him on his way."

There is general laughter. You glance at Bobby, but he motions you to keep listening.

>keep listening

>listen
"You seen tomorrow's detail yet?"

"Yeah, dress-up duty. Polishing helmets so we can look all pretty for the lords and ladies coming down to Baron Fussypants' ball."

"Not just lords and ladies, I heard. Word has it the Queen herself is on the guest list."

"Oh, pull the other one."

"Goddesses witness it. They say she's comin' down with her daughter in tow, that's why Fossville's hostin' the ball in the first place. He's tryin' to get in the Queen's good graces, so's he can marry the girl."

"What, the Queen?"

"No, you dim. He wants to marry the Princess. Our Lord Fussypants is trying to position himself for the throne."

"Well, he's welcome to it, long as I'm paid at week's end. Of course, I'm not looking forward to spending a night standing at attention for a horde of fancy, feathered fops to goggle and gaggle at, but I guess it's better than latrine duty..."

Bobby pulls you away. He's grinning, his eyes wide and his eyebrows cocked. Isn't it great?

But you're too nervous to care. There are who knows how many men of the Lord's Guard right on the other side of that door. Someone could walk out at any second. You grab Bobby's arm and give it a firm yank - It's time to go.

Tunnel End
The wall at the north end of the tunnel has swung open, revealing a secret entrance to the castle.

Bobby reaches back and pulls the secret door shut, carefully easing it the last few inches so that it doesn't slam. He puts the loose brick back in its place, just as before, and tugs his torch free of the bracket where he'd left it.

We're out, you realize with a sense of overwhelming relief. We made it. It's like we were never here.

"Some adventure, eh, Jack?" laughs Bobby. His voice is disturbingly loud after the long minutes of terrified silence in the keep. "Eavesdropping on the Lord's own guardsmen! That's a story that'll have the little ones wide-eyed at the Maiden House, eh?" He claps you on the back, and you manage a smile. It was fun, and you want Bobby to think you had fun, but it will be a while before you feel up to something that dangerous again.

>talk to bobby
Bobby raises his hand wordlessly, as if to say, not now.

>s
Stealthily, you creep back up the long tunnel to the stone steps under the fountain. "I'll go up first," whispers Bobby, "to make sure the coast is clear." He dunks his torch in a puddle of mud and bounds lightly up the steps. For a moment you can see him silhouetted against the starlight; then he moves away from the opening and disappears from view.

You wait for ten heartbeats. Behind you, you hear the distant plip of dripping moisture, far back in the dark tunnel. Above you, you can hear crickets chirping in the nearby forest.

Ten more heartbeats. "Bobby?" you call out in a hoarse whisper. Maybe he can't hear you, but you're too nervous to raise your voice. "Bobby? Are you up there?"

There is no answer.

The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.

>n
Ducking your head to avoid the low ceiling, you follow the tunnel for some distance.

Tunnel End
The tunnel ends here at a blank, stone wall.

>x stone wall
It's just a blank, featureless, stone wall. You know that one of the bricks must be loose, but they all look the same to you.  

>pull brick
It is fixed in place.

Underneath The Fountain

>up
You crawl out of the hole in the base of the statue, into the dirt and leaves littering the bottom of the fountain. Apart from your scrabbling, it's quiet out here. Even the crickets have stopped. Finally, you get to your feet and look around.

Bobby is lying face-down in the grass, just a few yards away. One of the mercenaries from Grubber's Market is kneeling with his knee in the small of Bobby's back, binding his wrists together with twine. Standing around the outside of the fountain are several more mercenaries, looking relaxed and smug. Some of them are chuckling to themselves.

A gaunt man wearing red robes walks up to you. His mouth is half-hidden by long, drooping, black moustaches, but underneath them he is smiling like a snake. "Well now, young...sir? Or is it 'miss'? So much confusion, all to catch one little mouse. You led us a merry chase this morning, little mouse, but I think you will not scurry away from us again."

Leaves crunch behind you. You jump for it, but too slow - rough hands haul you back, and a sack of coarse, black cloth is pulled over your head.

"Good night, little mouse."

Something hard and heavy strikes the back of your head, and the night turns black as pitch.

Chapter 3 - Jail 

Slowly the world comes back to you. You feel something cold and hard against your cheek; something gritty and scratchy under your hand. You hear footsteps on stone, muttering voices that fade in and out. Someone laughs, a raw, cruel sound. A loud squeak, and an echoing, metallic crash. The footsteps fade away.

You open your eyes. It's still dark.

No, it's just dim. Dim light trickles in from somewhere above you.

You sit up, and a tender spot on the back of your head throbs. Red and purple splotches bloom in front of your eyes, then fade away. After a moment or two, your head clears, and you can see where you are.

Holding Cell
A dank, cramped, foul-smelling cell. A pair of ragged burlap blankets and a few lumps of filthy straw litter the floor. The door is to the north. 

A hulking shape squats in the corner, staring at you with bloodshot eyes. 

>x blankets
The blankets are threadbare, filled with holes, and stained with Goddesses-know-what. You can hardly believe that anyone would actually cover themselves with something like this. 

>x straw
From the smell and the look of it, this straw is all prisoners ever get in the way of a toilet. 

Suddenly you hear a voice whisper your name. "Jack..."

At first you think it's the creepy guy in the corner, but he hasn't moved. You're still staring at him when the whisper comes again, louder this time: "Jack..." It's coming from somewhere outside the cell.

1. "Bobby? Is that you?"

>1
You rush up and press your face against the viewing window, but you can't see anything out there except an empty room. "Bobby?" you call, trying to keep the fear out of your voice. "Bobby, is that you? I'm locked in here, Bobby, help me!"

The voice chuckles, then coughs weakly. "I'm in the cell next to yours, Jack. I'm locked in, too. Sorry."

Your heart sinks a little at that, but at least being trapped in a cell with Bobby nearby is a little bit better than being trapped in a cell with no one around to help you at all... right?

"Jack, listen," Bobby says. His voice is ragged and hoarse; you're worried that the mercenaries might have hurt him badly. "I'm going to get us out of this mess, don't worry. But in case I'm not able to meet up with you after, you need to listen carefully."

1. "What do you mean?"

"Jack, listen to me. Go to Fossville's estate in the city. Use the rooftops. There's an alley behind the shops on Commerce Street where you can climb up."

"You want me to break into Baron Fossville's house?" you whisper back, incredulously. "Bobby, I don't understand-"

"He has secrets," Bobby goes on, "that you need to know. Secrets about your father."

You pause, stunned.

"Look for a letter-" says Bobby, but he is cut off by a door slamming open elsewhere in the room. Guards move past your cell door; one of them slams a wooden cudgel against the bars right in front of your face, and you stagger back.

>listen
You keep your ears pricked.

You hear a metallic rattling, the squeak of hinges. Then several meaty thuds, mixed with grunts and cries of pain. The guards reappear, this time dragging Bobby with them. He looks up as he passes the viewing window, and you get a brief glimpse of his face - bruised, bloody, but still smiling. You'd swear he was trying to wink at you, except that his eye is swollen shut.

"Fossville, Jack!" he yells as they bundle him off. "The rooftops! Look for the letter!"

Somewhere a door slams one final time... and then everything is silent.

You smell nothing unexpected.

Holding Cell
A dank, cramped, foul-smelling cell. A pair of ragged burlap blankets and a few lumps of filthy straw litter the floor. The door is to the north. 

A hulking shape squats in the corner, staring at you with bloodshot eyes. 

Suddenly the shadowy man in the corner puts his huge, thick-fingered hands on his knees and pushes himself up. "Well," he grunts in a thick, rough voice, "now that the guards are busy takin' care of him..." the man stretches, glances at you, and smiles. It is not a friendly smile.

"Hi, kid. Name's Jacobs."

1. "My name's Jack."
2. "Stay away from me!"
3. "Do you know any way to get out of here?"

>1
"Um... hi," you manage to say. "My name's, uh... Jack."

The man named Jacobs glances at you, a flicker of amusement crossing his dull, reddish eyes, but doesn't otherwise respond.

1. "Do you know any way to get out of here?"

>1
"Do you, uh...," you clear your throat, "...do you know some way we could get out of this place?"

Jacobs raises an eyebrow. "Well now, little runt. I suppose I do."

The hulking man walks over to the cell door and squints at it for a while, standing with his hands on his hips. "My father'll have me out of here by tomorrow, of course," he mutters, "but I don't like to wait that long." He barely looks at you - in fact, you're not sure that he's talking to you at all. It's more like he's just muttering to himself.

He bends over and digs something out of the side of his boot, then stands up and thrusts his hand through the viewing window. He curses and strains to push his arm through, but the bars are too narrowly spaced - he can't reach out past his elbow. "Damn," he mutters, "didn't expect this..."

>x jacobs
Jacobs is a huge brute, with a face that looks young, but already grizzled and rough beyond his years. His wide, watery eyes jitter constantly. His lip is curled in a constant half-sneer, as though his confinement in jail is merely a passing diversion for him. His clothes, though stained and rumpled, seem too rich to belong to a common thug. 

Jacobs' face reddens with effort. "C'mon... c'mon..." he mutters.

>l
Holding Cell
A dank, cramped, foul-smelling cell. A pair of ragged burlap blankets and a few lumps of filthy straw litter the floor. The door is to the north. 

Jacobs is pressed against the door, straining to force his beefy arm through the tiny, barred window. 

"Aaah! Goddesses curse it!" Jacobs jerks his hand back, rubbing his wrist.

"Well, you gonna help me, runt, or not?" he asks, and holds out a short, stiff piece of wire, pinched between his thumb and forefinger.

1. "What is that thing?"
2. "I'd rather not."
3. "Okay."

>1
"What is that thing?" you ask, squinting at the tiny wire - although you're pretty sure you already know.

"What are you, dim?" snarls Jacobs. "It's a lockpick. Now take it and help me get this door open."

1. "I'd rather not."
2. "Okay."

>1
Picking locks has never been your strong suit, and the idea of this brute breathing over your shoulder while you try it gives you stomach-flips. "Uh-uh," you say, holding up your hands and backing away. "I'd rather not, if it's all the same."

"Oh, for the love of - fine!" he yells. He throws the lockpick to the floor and stomps back to his corner. "I guess I'll just wait for my father, then. A hundred cells in this twice-cursed jail, and I get stuck in the one with a dim-witted, muling runt and a tiny window..."

>x lockpick
It's a short bit of stiff wire, like the ones you've sometimes seen Bobby carrying around. 

>take it
"That's the spirit, runt!" Jacobs says. Suddenly he comes over and puts his huge hands around your waist, hoisting you up as though you weighed no more than a sack of feathers. He feels strong enough to snap you in half.

"You ever pick a lock before, runt?"

1. "Yes."
2. "No."

>1
You manage a nod. It's sort of true... Bobby showed you a few tricks once, and you've practiced on the front door of Maiden House a couple of times. You've never had to do it when your life depended on it, reaching through a tiny, barred window, with a giant, crazy-eyed brute breathing down your neck. But perhaps it's best not to get hung up on details.

"Good," Jacob says, pushing you up against the viewing window. "This one should be easy, long as you can reach it."

>x window
The viewing window is just a tiny square, no more than two handspans to a side, fitted with tough, closely spaced iron bars. 

>pick lock
You slip your arm through the bars and reach down for the lock. It's a stretch - Jacobs has to lift you higher and press your shoulder painfully against the bars - but soon you feel the metal of the lockplate, and your fingers find the tiny, sharp-edged hole in the middle.

You jam the end of the lockpick in and start wiggling it around. Almost immediately, you realize that this is not going to work. The angle is too awkward, and you can't see what you're doing, and you can't feel the tumblers the way Bobby showed you when you practiced on the front door of Maiden House...

Then you feel the wire bump against something inside the lock. You manage to lever the end of the wire under something and push... you feel it start to give... you push a little harder, and it starts to pivot... you push harder, and it starts to slip off the end of your pick...

And then there is a snap, and the pick jumps out of your fingers and tumbles to the ground outside the cell door.

Jacobs puts you down. He puts his hand on the door... and pushes it open.

"Well," he says, looking you over with a sly expression, "you are a valuable runt, after all."

>open door
That's already open.

Jacobs goes north.

>follow jacobs
Which do you mean, Jacobs or Jacobs the Elder?

>jacobs
You don't see Jacobs the Elder here.

>*** Disambiguation problem here! (It shouldn't arise, since it should be obvious which Jacobs I meant)
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>out

Jailhouse
The jailhouse is hardly more comfortable than the cells themselves, just a crude, small room of unfinished stone, with a wooden bench and table for the guards. Cells are south, west, and north. A foul smell comes from a tiny alcove to the southwest, and a passageway to the east leads out.

Jacobs stands staring at you with bloodshot eyes. 

You can also see a lockpick here.

Jacobs turns to you. "I heard what your friend in the other cell said, before they dragged him out," he says. "Sounds like Fossville's taken quite an interest in you."

1. "Yes, he has."
2. "I don't know what you're talking about."

>1
You nod. "I guess he has," you say, "but I have no idea why."

The big man seems to consider something. "You can come with me if you want," he says. "I'll take you somewhere safe."

A shaky, wheedling voice from the north cell calls out: "Don't you listen to him, girl! That's Jacobs the Elder's son; he'd as soon sell you to slavers as help you."

"Shut up, you!" yells Jacobs, pounding on the cell door in a sudden rage.

1. "Sure, let's go."
2. "No, thanks."

>2
"No offense," you say, "but I'll find my own way out, thanks."

"Fine, then," Jacobs snarls, "good luck getting past the guards, runt." He turns on his heel and stalks out, leaving you alone with the other prisoners.

"Do us a kindness, girl, and free us as well," whines the man in the north cell. "We ain't done nothin' terrible, and we can show you a way out, too, one that doesn't include leaving you dead in an alley for your shoes."

1. "Hang on for a minute."
2. "All right, I'll let you out."
3. "Who are you?"

>save
Ok.

>1
"Just hang on for a minute," you tell him. "I need to look around.

"You are wise beyond your years, miss," the man says, sounding a bit disappointed. "I'm sure you'll do the right thing."

Drain Room
This tiny alcove reeks worse than the privy back at Maiden House, and that's saying something. The main room is back to the northeast.

Set into the stone floor is a metal grate.

>open grate
It's a strain, but you're just barely able to lift the heavy grate and drop it to the side with a dull clang.

>d
Well, it can't be that much worse than rotting in prison, you think. You sit down and dangle your feet over the edge of the hole. You can hear the sound of running water, and smell the sharp stink of sewage. You offer a quick prayer to Brigid - Please give me a chance to clean up before seeing Bobby again - take a deep breath, and drop down into darkness.
Chapter 4 - Sewer 

Sewer
The tunnels down here are made of ancient, unmortared brick, slimy with centuries of filth and mold. Dim light trickles down through narrow vents in the ceiling. Side tunnels split off in numerous directions, twisting away into darkness.

Painted on the walls are a number of odd symbols.

>** Should there be a line break or two before the next chapter heading?
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x symbols
The symbols are a number of crude shapes, no bigger than your hand. Each one is painted on the wall next to one of the side tunnels, as if to mark the way. You can make out a red square next to the north tunnel, a red square next to the east tunnel, a red square next to the south tunnel and a red square next to the west tunnel.

Suddenly you find yourself in a tunnel where there are no symbols painted anywhere. You try to retrace your steps, but you must have taken a wrong turn somewhere, because now you can't find any symbols anywhere. All of the tunnels look alike; you are completely turned around and don't even know which direction you are stumbling in.

The next tunnel you take leads you to an area with no vents - it is pitch black. You slip as you turn around and fall into the water. Something slick and wriggly brushes past your face, and you thrash to your feet.

You can't see any light, anywhere. You don't know what direction you just came from. Cold, smelly water numbs your feet. Despair and paralyzing panic close in on you as you realize that you have no means of finding your way through this labyrinth.

You are stuck down here, blind in the stinking blackness, forever.

"Oh, thank you, miss, thank you kindly. Goddesses' blessings upon you. Allow me to make introductions," the man wheezes. "I am called Olmer, and this is my associate, Darrens." The skinny man standing behind him smiles and nods enthusiastically.

"Now," says Olmer, "if you will follow us, we will make our escape."

"The guards use this place to relieve themselves," Olmer explains, "and sometimes for beatin' prisoners when they don't feel like moppin' the cells after. My back's not much for physical labor, but a spry one like yourself should have little trouble." He motions for you to lift up the grate.

>open grate

A short, bald-headed man, with a week's worth of stubble on his neck and a nose bright red from burst blood vessels. His breath reeks of cheap spirits, and his watery eyes shift constantly, as though always looking for a way out of his current predicament. 

>x darrens
He's a tall, wobbly scarecrow of a man, with a huge nose, ears like jug handles jutting from the sides of his head, and a throat-apple the size of a child's fist that bobs up and down constantly. He never speaks; just smiles and nods whenever anyone says or does anything. You suspect he may be a few coins short of a full purse. 

>talk to olmer
"Let me ask you something," you say.

"Of course," wheezes Olmer.

1. "Why doesn't your friend talk?"
2. "What are you doing in prison?"
3. "What have you got against Jacobs?"
4. "Where does the drain lead?"

>1
You nod towards the red-faced man's skinny friend. "The tall one," you ask, "why doesn't he ever talk?"

"Oh, Darrens wasn't always a mute," Olmer explains. "One o' the Lord's Guard caught him nickin' from the fruit stall in Grubber's a few years back. Kicked him in the head 'til the blood came out his ears, and his eyes stayed crossed for near on a week. He's never been quite right since."

Darrens nods sadly.

1. "What are you doing in prison?"
2. "What have you got against Jacobs?"
3. "Where does the drain lead?"

>1
"What did you do to end up in prison?" you ask.

"Oh, nothin' worse than the Lord's Guard gets up to themselves on payday," wheezes Olmer. "A weakness for the drink is our curse. Every now and again the Goddesses see fit to bless me with an opportunity to learn from my shameful mistakes." He gives you a wide, gap-toothed grin.

1. "Why doesn't your friend talk?"
2. "What have you got against Jacobs?"
3. "Where does the drain lead?"

>2
"What have you got against Jacobs?" you ask.

"That Jacobs is a brute and a scoundrel," Olmer says. "He'd sell his own mother to slavers if he thought there'd be a profit in it, and if his pirate of a father didn't get to her first."

1. "Why doesn't your friend talk?"
2. "What are you doing in prison?"
3. "Where does the drain lead?"

>3
"That drain," you ask, "where does it lead?"

"Down to the sewers, it does miss," says Olmer excitedly. "Tunnels, leading all under the city. A crafty bloke without too delicate a sensibility could escape to anywhere. But it's very easy to get lost; you'll need Darrens and me to find your way."

Painted on the walls are a number of odd symbols.

Olmer drops down into the muck next to you, followed by Darrens. "Now then, miss, cast your eye at these glyphs here," whispers Olmer. His voice echoes off into the blackness as he brushes the rough stone with his fingertips. "These are marked down by such poor blokes as have to take refuge down here on a more regular basis. They tells you where the tunnels lead, if you but know their language." Darrens nods in solemn agreement.

"To get back to your neighborhood, you'll want to follow the red, see?" Olmer points off down the north tunnel. "Darrens and I, we must be off elsewhere, so we'll take our leave of you now. But follow the red and you can't go wrong."

"It was very kind of you to set us free, young lady." He shakes your hand. (His hands are slimy with filth, but then so are yours.) "We've only our meagre gratitude with which to repay you, but we won't forget your generosity." Darrens nods vigorously and shakes as well.

And then the two of them slosh off, leaving you alone.

Chapter 5 - Black Gate Estate 

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs east to west, between Grubber's Market and Lord's Market. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east. 

>** Again, break needed before chapter heading (or does this happen anyway in the FyreVM?)
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>e

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

>e

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south.

Butcher's Shop
Chains of linked sausages and thick, red cuts of meat dangle from hooks in the ceiling, and trays of less identifiable bits sit out on the counters. It's better than some butcheries you've seen, but it's still not your favorite place in the city. You can leave to the south.

Old Man Holstenoffer is leaning over his huge, bloodstained butcher block behind the counter, hacking up some carcass.

Holstenoffer looks up as you enter his shop, and his eyes widen. "Goddesses, Jack," he says, "you look like you've had the worse of it. Widow Fiona was just in this morning, lookin' for yeh. Is everything all right?"

1. "Have you seen Bobby?"
2. "Is there a back door here?"

>1
"Have you seen Bobby since last night?" you ask desperately. "Or heard anything?"

"Well, no," Holstenoffer says. His wide brow creases in concern. "What's wrong, Jack? Is Bobby in some kind of trouble?"

1. "No, I'm just looking for him."
2. "Yes, he's been captured by Fossville's men."

>2
"It was Fossville!" you blurt out before you can stop to think whether you should. "His mercenaries captured Bobby and me in the woods north of town... I got away, but Bobby's still in jail."

Holstenoffer's jaw clenches and he shakes his head. "Aw, stupid, brave lad. And that rotten Fossville. I'm so sorry, Jack. If I can do anything for yeh, just tell me, all right?"

1. "Is there a back door here?"

>1
"Listen, is there a back door in your shop?" you ask, craning to see around Holstenoffer's huge frame.

"Yeah..." he says slowly, giving you an odd look. "Don't lead to nothin' but a closed-off alley, though. What do yeh want back there for?"

1. "Just let me back there."
2. "It's to help Bobby."

"Please, Holstenoffer," you say, "just let me back there."

He looks you square in the eye. "Now look, Jack," he says, pointing his cleaver at you, "Yer a good lad and I like yeh, but I can't go lettin' urchins run through my shop whenever they've got a hankerin', yeh know? If you want me to help yeh, yer gonna have to tell me what's going on.

1. "It's to help Bobby."

>1
You take a deep breath. "I need to get up onto the rooftops, so I can get to... a place." You're not sure if Holstenoffer would actually disapprove of breaking into Fossville's house, in principle, but he probably wouldn't approve of you doing it yourself. "Please, Holstenoffer. I need to get up there to help Bobby."

Holstenoffer looks at you for a few moments, then nods his head. "All right then. Come around the counter here."

You follow the burly butcher to the back of his shop, where he unlocks and opens a small metal door. "Be safe now, Jack," he says, laying a thick hand on your shoulder. "Do what yeh have to do."

A twinge of guilt nags at you. Technically, you don't have any idea whether this letter will help Bobby or not, although you certainly hope it does. But what else can you do? "Thanks," you whisper, and step through the door.

Closed Alleyway
The walls of the alley are so close together you can barely squeeze your shoulders through; the rough brick and mortar catches at your clothes. The ends of the alley are walled off. There's no way out except back through the little door you came in.

A rusted rain gutter clings to the wall.

>x rain gutter
The pipe is old and rusty, and only barely still attached to the brick wall in some places... still, it might hold your weight. 

>pull pipe
It is fixed in place.

>climb it
You give the pipe a few experimental tugs, then take a deep breath and start shimmying up. The rain gutter squeaks and groans in protest. Your fingers cramp and your toes scrabble to find purchase on the rough bricks. Finally, three stories up, you grab the edge of the rooftop and haul yourself over.

Rooftop
The rooftops are like a miniature mountain range up here, with peaks and valleys sloping away into the distance. Chimneys and stovepipes stand sentry like the keeps and towers of castles. Bobby has exclaimed the virtues of rooftop travel before, and finally you see what he was going on about. It feels like you could explore forever up here.

>jump
You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

>x chimneys
Cheery smoke billows up from several of the chimneys.

Rooftop Edge
The rooftop landscape ends here at a wide street dividing Commerce Street from the more affluent residential district that borders it. Far, far below, you can see all the little people going about their business.

To the east, across the gap, you spy a balcony.

>x little people
You can't see any such thing.

>x people
All the people way down there on Commerce Street look like ants from up here.

>** add "little" as synonym

>x balcony
It's an ornately decorated balcony, jutting out from what looks like a rooftop garden. Judging from the layout of the streets below you, that must be Baron Fossville's house. 

>jump
You peer across the gap at the balcony, judging the distance. About ten feet. Maybe a little bit more than ten feet. And it's slightly below you, which is a plus.

Still, it's a really far jump.

This is where Bobby told you to go. A letter... secrets about your father, he said. The thought of facing Bobby when he gets out, after they beat him up so bad, and telling him you were too scared to do what he asked you to do...

You take a few steps back, run... and jump.

The railing slams into your chest, knocking the breath out of you. Your feet pedal madly in empty air. You wrap your arms around the railing, trying to grab on, but you're slipping...

Then your foot finds the edge of the balcony, and you push yourself up and over.

Balcony
You're standing on a balcony, complete with ornate railing, that runs along the roof's western edge. To the northeast is a garden; to the southeast, a patio.

>x railing
The curved, elegant railing is made of white marble and gilt iron. 

>pull it

>eat it

That's hardly portable.

>climb it

If at all possible, you'd much rather find an escape route that doesn't involve death-defying leaps over fifty-foot drops. Besides, you can't leave until you find the letter Bobby was talking about.

Rooftop Garden
The garden is an impressive piece of greenery in a city otherwise dominated by stone. Most of the flowers are not in bloom this late in the season, but there are autumn roses, and some nice hanging lilies climbing up a lattice. The patio is south, and the balcony lies to the southwest. Nearby, a flight of steps leads down into the lower floors of the house.

The patio is south, and the balcony lies to the southwest. Nearby, a flight of steps leads down into the lower floors of the house.

>climb down steps
Holding your breath, you tiptoe quietly down the stairs. A prickle runs up your spine; you are now an intruder. If the Baron catches you here, he'll have you tossed back into a jail cell - and that's the best case scenario. If what Bobby told you is true, and Fossville knows secrets about you that he's trying to hide, it's more likely he'll just slit your throat.

Have to move quickly, then - search the house, find this letter, and get out.

The sounds of sudden, frantic activity drift up the stairs: footsteps, chairs scraping on wooden floors, glasses and dishes clinking.

On a sudden impulse, you pick a random book from the shelf of older books. A folded sheet of parchment slips out from the pages and see-saws to the floor.

>take parchment
Taken.

The parchment is thin and the ink faded, but the writing is still quite legible, a strong, graceful script that flows down the page.

Your Royal Highness, it begins,

It is with a sad but hopeful heart that I write to you, for I must reveal deeds that I am not proud of, and yet perhaps I may thereby put an end to an injustice that has gone on far too long.

My lawful marriage was determined by political expediency rather than by the urgings of my own heart, as you well know. My wife was ever a dutiful companion, but never truly happy. I do not blame her. For my part, I did my best to ensure that she lived a lifestyle fitting for a Duchess, and that she wanted for nothing save my love.

Were this the full extent of my shame, I would have no need to write to you, for a loveless marriage is hardly a rare thing in our kingdom. However, it is to confess yet a further disgrace that I must pen this letter. I was not merely cool in my affections, but an unfaithful husband as well. I took a mistress, a woman on whom I bestowed all the tenderness I was unable to give my wife. And with this mistress, I had a child.

I kept the child's existence a secret, as much to spare my wife the ignominy as to avoid the political complications that would otherwise have ensued. From my private finances I established an orphanage here in the city, and paid a tutor from the Royal College to pose as one of the headmistresses, to raise and educate the child properly. In secret I have sponsored this child for ten years.

I feel it is past time for this secrecy to end. I have grown ill with a mysterious sickness these past months, and I fear that my life will soon come to a close. My wife was never able to provide me with a lawful heir, and yet I would not see my family name extinguished merely because I had not the courage to face up to my failings as a husband.

Therefore it is my wish that the crown recognize this child, who bears no fault for the circumstances of her birth, as my sole and lawful beneficiary, to inherit my title and estate in full upon my death, or upon her sixteenth birthday should I die before she reaches the age of majority. I hereby, by my will and by royal law, and in full possession of my faculties, declare my heir:

           Jacqueline Toresal

Signed and witnessed therewith,

Lord William, Duke of Toresal

 

Your hand is trembling as you refold the letter. You tell yourself that it's a coincidence, just someone who happens to have the same first name as you - but in your heart you know it must be true.

And yet... it poses so many more questions than it answers. The letter is addressed to the queen, and dated three years ago, just a few months before the Duke's death. Why was it never posted? And what is it doing in Baron Fossville's library?

A noise from the bedroom startles you out of your puzzling. Now that you have what you came for, you need to get out of here - fast.

You leave the library in a rush - and run smack into someone coming the other way.

It's all you can do to bite back a scream. You try to duck around the person and run, but he grabs your arm and pulls you back. "Little thief!" a voice hisses, "What are you doing here? What do you have?"

He turns you around to face him. He's an older man, wearing a servant's uniform - Fossville's butler.

Master Bedroom
The bedroom, as you might have expected, is dominated by an enormous bed and not much else. Sliding doors lead north, back to the parlor, and another doorway leads south.

A butler is standing here, eyeing you suspiciously.

>x butler
The butler is tall and somewhat gaunt, with a heavy brow and a sour, twisted cast to his mouth. He looks like he doesn't like kids very much, especially when they're somewhere they shouldn't be. 

The butler drags you into the stairwell, then stops, his thin, bald head cocked, listening. From downstairs you hear more voices.

"...difficult is it to keep one half-witted street urchin locked in a cage for a single night?" That's the Baron again, you realize. "Because it is evidently far more difficult than I imagined. Perhaps I am not paying you enough for your heroic efforts so far?"

You hear a low, mumbled response.

"No, I daresay you don't," snaps the Baron, his voice acid with sarcasm. "I cannot express how galling it is that I still require your services; were it otherwise, I would sooner turn you all over to the Lord's Guards and let them deal with you like the useless curs you are."

The butler glances at you, one bushy eyebrow raised. You're beginning to suspect that Baron Fossville is not particularly well liked by his servants.

>talk to butler
"Hush," the butler snaps, cutting you off. "I've no great desire to see the master inflict his cruelties upon a child, but I'll not lose my position over it. Keep your lips sealed if you want to leave this place unscathed."

"Gather your men at Lord's Market," says Fossville. "We'll deal with the spy first. Once that business is finished, we pay a visit to the Widows. Though I suppose I should warn you - you may encounter several unarmed, elderly women there. Let us hope they pose no greater challenge to your mercenaries than a fourteen-year-old girl."

The second voice mumbles another response.

"See that you do. I will be there shortly."

You hear footsteps, and then a heavy door slamming.

The butler holds his hand up, palm out. Wait.

>wait
Time passes.

Several agonizing minutes later, you hear the door slam a second time. The butler waits a few minutes more, then drags you downstairs. He takes you through the kitchens to a side door, and shoves you unceremoniously out onto the street.

"Go now, and don't come back," he says. "Next time, it won't be me that catches you. And if it is me, it'll go that much worse for you. A bit of advice, girl," he adds, just before turning away. "Keep yourself out of the Baron's way. He's not one to let a trifling of blood get in between him and his ambitions."

He slams the door.
Chapter 6 - Gallows 

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

There seems to be some sort of spectacle going on in Lord's Market; pedestrians are crowding the streets, pressing east.

>save

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is packed with people from every part of the city, all of them pressing in, blocking the streets. You've never seen it this crowded before. 

There is some sort of wooden structure erected in the center of the square.

>x structure
It's a raised platform, with some sort of scaffolding built over it, and a rope dangling from...

Suddenly your mouth goes dry. It's a gallows.

>x people
The crowd is made up of people from every part of the city. Men and women, aristocrats and servants, merchants and beggars, all rubbing shoulders and craning to see. 

A man steps up onto the wooden platform. By squeezing between two spectators and craning your neck, you can just make out that it is Baron Fossville addressing the crowd.

"Citizens of Toresal," he shouts, "as Lord of this City, it is my duty to administer justice within its gates, and punish those who transgress against the Queen's Law. More often than not, this duty is a heavy burden. Though I may wish to be lenient, consideration for the sanctity of the law and the safety of the Queen's subjects must always outweigh my softer instincts. Today, this burden weighs particularly upon me, for today I must administer the most stringent punishment allowed by the law."

Soldiers prod a second man up onto the platform. The black bag covers his face, but you recognize him by the clothes he's wearing - it's Bobby!

>attack baron
You can't reach him. There are too many people in the way.

"This man before you stands accused of plotting high treason against the city of Toresal," shouts the Baron. "The evidence against him has been weighed, and he has been found guilty by the Honorable Magistrate Hester Rudup."

Fossville gestures to a third man standing on his other side, a gaunt man wearing crimson robes - the man who captured you last night at the fountain.

>shout
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x rudup
He looks much the same as he did when you encountered him last night, although now he is wearing his magistrate's chain of office over the red robes. He stares coolly out over the crowd. 

"Despite the grief it causes me, the penalty for this most heinous crime is clear." Fossville pauses; the crowd is hanging on his every word. "By the power invested in me and in accordance with the Queen's Law... I hereby sentence this man to hang by the neck until dead."

The Baron turns to one of his soldiers at the platform's base and nods his head.

Later, you cannot remember whether you really heard the clunk of the trapdoor falling open, the rope snapping taut, or whether you only imagined it. You remember screaming, clawing at the spectators in front of you, and being pushed back by rough, angry hands. You stumbled and fell onto the cobblestones. You never saw his body drop.

Everything goes black.

Chapter 7 - Mercenaries Again 

You are lying on something soft. Blankets, a thin mattress - you're back in Maiden House, lying in your own bunk. Fiona is sitting on the edge of the bed, watching you with a tender expression. Her eyes are red and raw, though, like she's been crying. For a moment, you feel strange, disconnected. You wonder what's wrong.

And then it comes back to you. It's Bobby. Bobby is dead.

You feel like there's something important you should say to Fiona, but you can't think of what it is.

1. "How did I get here?"
2. "I'm sorry I snuck out."
3. "Bobby is dead. They killed Bobby."

>3
"Bobby..." you manage to say, but then your throat closes up around the words, and it hurts. It's like choking on something that's swelling, getting bigger and bigger inside you...

...and then something breaks inside, and it all comes gushing out. Fiona's arms are around you, and your tears are soaking into her blouse as the sobs rack their way up from the deepest part of your gut, and she is whispering, "Oh child... oh my dear child..."

"Buh-buh-Bobby..." you wail, feeling stupid and weak and scared and guilty and oh, so alone. How did this happen? You were talking to him just yesterday. You snuck out for a lark, and now he's... he's...

"Hush," Fiona says softly, stroking your hair. "I know, child. I know."

I never told him my name! you want to scream. You never told him your real name, and you never told him how you felt about him, and now he's dead, and he never really knew you at all.

But then you remember the letter, and all the things Bobby told you in the Jail... what if he did know you? What if he knew you even better than you knew yourself?

Suddenly, someone pounds on the front door. The sobs freeze in your throat as a voice outside shouts, "Open in the name of Baron Fossville!"

Fiona looks horrified. "It's the Baron!" she whispers. "I didn't think he'd come here so soon... quick, Jacqueline! Go to the laundry room!"

>talk to fiona
"There's no time for that now," she cries, "just go!"

The pounding continues. "Open this door, widow, before we break it down!"

Hallway
The main hallway runs through the center of Maiden House, with several doorways leading to rooms on either side. To the southeast and southwest are the laundry and privy, respectively; to the northeast lies the kitchen; and to the northwest is the dormitory where you and the other orphans sleep.

The front door is closed.

Widow Fiona arrives from the northwest.

The pounding continues. "Open up!"

>kiss fiona
Fiona wraps her arms around you and hugs you tightly. Her cheeks are wet against yours. "Oh, child," she whispers. "You've been like a daughter to me, you know."

The pounding continues. "Open this door, widow, before we break it down!"

>se
Laundry
The air in here is filled with steam and the sharp stink of lye soap. Moisture trickles down the walls, and puddles of water splash underfoot. The main hallway lies northwest.

As you enter the room, Widow Shannon rushes over and pushes against one of the boards in the northern wall. It moves aside, revealing a narrow, dark opening.

"Quick, Jacqueline," she whispers, "in here!"

The pounding continues.

>kiss shannon
Widow Shannon hugs you tightly. "You're a brave girl, Jacqueline," she whispers. "Now let's get going."

The pounding continues, rattling the door in its frame.

>n
You squeeze in, and Shannon pulls the board back into place, shutting you into darkness.

Secret Closet
It is pitch black. The walls press close to either side; you can barely breathe.

The pounding continues. "Open up!"

>listen
The sound of your own harsh breathing fills the tiny alcove. If they weren't shouting so much, you're sure the mercenaries outside would be able to hear you.

The pounding suddenly stops. Heavy footsteps tromp into the building, making the floorboards shudder beneath your feet.

"Where is she?" growls a rough voice. It's hard to tell from two rooms away, but it sounds very similar to the mercenary captain you heard yesterday morning, at the Grubber's Market.

>jump
You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

"Where is who, sir?" That must be Fiona.

"Don't play games with me, woman," snaps the first voice. "I've had my fill of it. The old Duke isn't here to protect you anymore, and if one of my men were to be careless and injure someone, it would rest but lightly on the Baron's conscience. Now, we know she came here after the hanging. Where is she?"

"I can tell you, good sir," says a third voice.

Bitter anger wells up in your throat, even as fear turns your stomach cold. That was Theresa!

>** Would I have space to jump in the closet?
I didn't understand that sentence.

>listen
The sound of your own harsh breathing fills the tiny alcove.

"Widow Theresa-" Fiona begins, in a strangled voice, but Theresa interrupts her.

"Oh, do spare us your indignation, Fiona," she snaps. "I've stood by for years while you protected and coddled that child, and I tell you I've had my fill of it. Now she has done something unconscionable - obviously, or else the good Baron would not be looking for her - and I for one will not stand in the way of the law merely so that you can continue to bestow favoritism on one ungrateful little brat."

There is a long silence. You can feel your cheeks burning. Theresa has always disliked you, but you never thought she would be so treacherous as to turn you over to the Baron's men.

>s
The Baron's men would catch you the instant you left this hiding place.

Finally, Theresa speaks: "If you look in the laundry room, you will find a hidden closet in the north wall. The child is hiding there."

"My thanks, madam," grunts the mercenary captain. "I'll make sure the Baron hears of your cooperation when we-"

Suddenly Shannon is screaming, "Jacqueline! Jacqueline, wait!" Shouts. Running footsteps. What is going on? You hear footsteps coming down the hall, towards the laundry room... closer, closer... but then they suddenly turn away from the laundry room, towards... the privy?

"Jacqueline... oh, Goddesses." That's Shannon's voice.

"What is it?" yells the mercenary captain. "Where did the girl go?"

"She... she got away from me, Miss Fiona," wails Shannon. "I was trying to get her into the hiding place, just like you said, but she slipped past me and wriggled out the privy window. You know how fast she can get through that window, Miss Fiona. She could be anywhere in the city by now. I'm so sorry, Miss Fiona, so sorry."

You can't help but grin. You've always thought of Shannon as being a trifle dim-witted, and now you'll have to revise your opinion.

>listen
The sound of your own harsh breathing fills the tiny alcove.

The mercenary captain utters a curse so foul that you actually wince. "Don't just stand there, you bleeding dims," he yells, "get out there and find her! You two, keep an eye on the alley in case she comes back. Go! Go! Find her or I'll have your hides!" The footsteps run back up the hall, growing fainter this time, then vanishing altogether as they cross the threshold and exit Maiden House.

You let out a long, shaky breath.

>z
Time passes.

The door opens, and Shannon takes your hand as you stumble out of the stifling darkness.

"That was too close," she says.

Laundry
The air in here is filled with steam and the sharp stink of lye soap. Moisture trickles down the walls, and puddles of water splash underfoot. The main hallway lies northwest.

A gap between boards in the northern wall leads into a tiny, dark closet.

Widow Shannon is here, looking scared but determined.

>hug shannon
"No time for that now, Jacqueline," Shannon says.

>z
Time passes.

>talk to shannon
"We can talk later," Shannon says, gently pushing you towards the door. "Right now you should go talk to Widow Fiona."

>out

Hallway
The main hallway runs through the center of Maiden House, with several doorways leading to rooms on either side. To the southeast and southwest are the laundry and privy, respectively; to the northeast lies the kitchen; and to the northwest is the dormitory where you and the other orphans sleep.

The front door is open.

Widow Fiona and Widow Theresa are standing in the middle of the hallway, staring each other down. Theresa looks sullen but defiant; Fiona is livid with rage.

They are silent for a long, tense moment. Then Widow Theresa looks away.

"Get out," chokes Fiona. Her arm is extended, one pale finger pointing at the front door. "Get out and never set foot in this orphanage again. Perhaps when the nights grow cold you may rely on the charity of your precious Baron."

Theresa looks at you once - a bitter, helpless glare - and then turns on her heel and walks out, slamming the door behind her.

Widow Fiona takes a deep breath, then turns to you and smiles weakly. "Now, then. We don't have much time before the Baron's men come back, and I'm sure you have questions."

1. "You're the tutor, aren't you?"
2. "Tell me about my father."
3. "What will happen to Widow Theresa?"
4. "What do I do now?"

>1
Suddenly a piece of the mystery clicks into place. "You're the tutor, aren't you?" you ask. It isn't really a question. "The old Duke... my father... he hired you to keep an eye on me, didn't he."

Fiona nods. "Yes, that's right. The Duke had this orphanage built and placed you in it, and he brought me down from Aubrimere to look after you and see to your education. That was almost fourteen years ago, and I've been watching over you ever since."

1. "Tell me about my father."
2. "What will happen to Widow Theresa?"
3. "What do I do now?"

>1
"Then it's true," you say, half to yourself. "The Duke of Toresal really was my father. And you knew him!"

Fiona nods again. "I'm sorry I could not tell you sooner, Jacqueline," she says.

"Tell me about him," you say.

She sighs. "To tell you everything you want to know would take too long, and the Baron's men will be back soon. Please, Jacqueline, there's so much you need to know now; there will be time to learn more once you're out of danger."

1. "What will happen to Widow Theresa?"
2. "What do I do now?"

>1
"What will happen to Widow Theresa?" you ask. You're actually surprised to discover that you even care. But you've never seen Widow Fiona that angry at anyone before, and it was a little frightening.

Her face hardens. "She won't have much trouble being hired on as a servant or nanny," she says. "But I'll not waste precious time worrying about the fate of a woman who'd turn a child over to armed mercenaries."

1. "What do I do now?"

>1
You take a deep breath. "What am I supposed to do now?" you ask.

"First, you must leave this place. The Baron's men will be back, and they won't be fooled so easily again. You'll need to go quickly, out the privy window." Although her manner is urgent, Fiona smiles a bit at that. "It's a route you're accustomed to, to be sure."

She takes a large brass key from her pocket and presses it into your hand. "It's time you learned something of your past, Jacqueline. This is yours by right. It is the key to Red Gate Manor, and it opens the way to your history. Once you are away and safe, go there and find the answers that I can't give you now."

"Finally, when all that is done, go and speak to Dame Sandler in Lord's Market. She is a friend, and more importantly her allegiances are not known to Baron Fossville. She will set you on the road to reclaiming your birthright."

Fiona pulls you close and hugs you tight. "Oh child," she whispers, "I have loved you like a daughter for so long. Go now, and quickly. Be safe."

>hug fiona
Fiona puts her hands on your shoulders and holds you away. "I love you, too, Jacqueline," she says, "but we haven't time for that now."

>x her
Widow Fiona's eyes are red and swollen, as if she's been weeping, and a heavy sadness weighs on her usually cheerful features.

Privy
Not much more than a narrow closet, with a hole in the floor and a bench over it. At least it's more private than an alley.

A narrow window over the bench provides some ventilation.

>go through window
Chapter 8 - Red Gate Estate 

You pull yourself through the window and once again clamber up into the alley. You can hear a commotion from the direction of Lord's Market; it looks as though the Baron's mercenaries are still out searching the streets for you, but they'll double back and put a watch on Maiden House soon enough.

There is a scrabbling, grunting sound behind you, and you turn to see Shannon trying to push her way through the window. Confused but not wanting to just stand there and watch her struggle, you give her a hand up.

"Fiona thought I should maybe come with you," she says, after she's finished smoothing her skirts and catching her breath. "In case you needed any help."

Behind Maiden House
This tiny spur of an alleyway runs between the back of Maiden House and the high stone wall surrounding the park. You can make your way around to the Maiden House Entrance to the northeast.

>** Once again I didn't get a proper chapter break
I didn't understand that sentence.

>ne
Shannon lays a hand on your elbow. "Wait, Jacqueline," she whispers. "The mercenaries will be watching the entrance. We'd best cut through the park. I'll help you climb the wall."

>climb wall
Shannon laces her fingers together and gives you a boost up to the top of the wall; then you reach down and help pull her up. You both drop down onto the grass on the other side, and then it's a quick sprint across the open space of the park. Fortunately, no one is about after the awful spectacle in Lord's Market, and you make it to the relative safety of East Commerce Street without anyone spotting you.

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

Widow Shannon stands nearby.

>x shannon
Shannon is the youngest of the widows in Maiden House. She is plain-looking, and you've always thought of her as not particularly bright... but she is resourceful and devoted, and your respect for her has grown. She seems energetic and happy to be on this adventure with you. 

>talk to her
"Can I ask you something, Shannon?" you ask.

"Of course, Miss Jacqueline," she says.

1. "Did you know about Fiona?"
2. "Why is Dame Sandler so important?"
3. "What if you get caught?"

>1
"Did you know about Fiona being a special tutor?" you ask. "Did you know about me... and about my father?"

"Oh, no, Fiona never let on that you were special. Well," Shannon says, looking a bit embarassed, "I always thought you were special, Jacqueline. But that was just my own feelings telling me things, the way they do sometimes."

1. "Why is Dame Sandler so important?"
2. "What if you get caught?"

>1
"Why did Fiona want me to see Dame Sandler?" you ask. "What does she have to do with all of this?"

"I don't know," says Shannon, "but I do know that Widow Fiona has known her for a long time. Fiona had dealings with many people in the city that we never knew about. Sometimes she'd go off for the whole day and not come back until late at night." She smirks. "Widow Theresa always hated that."

1. "Did you know about Fiona?"
2. "What if you get caught?"

>2
"It's very nice of you to come with me, Shannon," you say, "but I'm worried if we get caught by Fossville's men." Your stomach clenches as you remember what happened to Bobby. "I don't... I don't want anything to happen to you."

Widow Shannon pats your arm. "Oh, Jacqueline, I couldn't leave you to face all this alone. And don't you worry - if those mercenaries come after me, I'll run straight to Holstenoffer's shop. I'd like to see how tough they are once they're in swinging range of his cleaver."

You try to imagine an enraged Holstenoffer protecting his lady-love, and you aren't sure whether it makes you want to smile or shudder.

1. "Did you know about Fiona?"
2. "Why is Dame Sandler so important?"

"We should stay away from Lord's Market for a while, I think," says Shannon. "Fossville's men will still be looking for you."

(first opening the front gates)
The lock is rusty and stiff from long disuse, but the key turns... and the door unlocks with a grinding clunk.

Shannon follows silently.

You pause for one last glance over your shoulder at the streets of Toresal, so familiar from your years of skulking, scrounging, and sometimes even sleeping on them. Then you pass over the threshold, into Red Gate Estate.

Entrance Hall
The entrance hall is large, high-ceilinged, and empty but for a few chairs. Your footsteps echo on the marble floor. A doorway leads north to further rooms, and the street lies south.

The house is eerie in its stillness. The walls are bare; and all the furniture is draped in white sheets.

Kitchen
The kitchen seems particularly barren, empty of its usual clutter of pots and pans and utensils. The firepit in the southwestern corner is cold and dark. The dining room lies south, and a wide staircase in the back of the room leads up to the second floor.

>x firepit

Widow Shannon stands nearby.

>show box to shannon
Widow Shannon is unimpressed.

>** Really?
I didn't understand that sentence.

>open box
Nestled in the box's velvet-lined interior are bundles of papers - letters and documents of the old Duke.

>read letters
Some of them are legal documents indicating the disposition of the old Lord's estate. There are also financial records of the city's Treasury, details of various funds and improvements he planned to implement before he died. There are letters from noblemen and noblewomen from every corner of Miradania, addressing the Duke in terms of the utmost deference and respect.

My father was a great and powerful man, you realize, skimming over the letters. People thought very highly of him.

At the bottom of the stack are several letters written on small, worn parchment. The penmanship is clumsy, like the way yours looked when Fiona was first teaching you your letters. Each is short, no more than a few scribbled sentences:

My Lord. I had some time to myself in the garden and thought of you. I hope to see you again soon if your duties will let you get away. You can see I've not put my name to this like you asked but you know who it is. Your Love.

Dear Love. When will I see you again? Your duties keep you too long from me. But that is why I love you so, you are a good man who never forsakes his duty. Come see me soon. Your Love.

My precious Duke. I pressed Estelle with subtle questions but I am certain she knows nothing. I am discreet and would never give you cause to worry. Our secret is safe. Your Love.

Your mother's words, you realize. Secret letters that she sent to your father, before you were born. He would have had no pictures of her, of course, nor any papers containing clues to her identity. These pieces of paper are all you will ever have of her. 

>show letters to shannon
Shannon looks close to tears as you show her the letters. "Your father was such a compassionate man," she whispers. "I just think it's terrible that he was forced to hide away everything that he truly loved.

Bathroom
The walls of this small room are cold, bare marble. The only exit is to the north.

A pair of strange-looking devices protrudes from the south wall, hanging over the lip of a huge stone basin.

>x devices
The devices are made of brass and ivory and protrude from carved fittings in the wall, at about waist height. They consist of a curved spout flanked by two hand-sized, spoked wheels...

Suddenly you figure it out - these are faucets! Running-water pipes, or "plumbing" as some call them, are a very recent invention, incredibly rare in Toresal. You've never actually seen faucets up close before.

"Oh, a bath with water-pipes! What a luxury," exclaims Shannon. "I've never had a bath that I didn't have to fill myself from a kettle. Back and forth and back and forth - it's either that or take it cold. Kind of takes the relaxation out of it, if you ask me," she sighs ruefully. "The Lord Duke was a man of taste and distinction on top of everything else. True nobility, he was."

And it occurs to you, as you look at your distorted reflection in the golden, curving pipes, you've never had a bath with running water, either. In fact, you can't remember the last time you had any sort of bath, not even the quick spit-baths in a wooden tub full of tepid, cloudy water that are the norm in Maiden House. You've spent your life coated with the grime of the streets more often than not, reeking of sweat and alleyways, hardly noticing it because the smell is around you constantly, and around everyone you know.

But, you realize for the first time, that's not really who you are. You are the Duke's daughter, a child of nobility. By all rights, you should have been sleeping on feather mattresses, smelling of rosewater. This luxury is your heritage... and you've never known a single day of it in your life.

>take a bath
You plug the drain and begin filling the enormous tub with water.

Shannon nods with approval but says nothing; somehow she seems to know what you were thinking. By the time you've gotten out of your sodden clothes and into the water, she's managed to scare up a cake of soap from somewhere. She smiles as she hands it to you.

The water is scalding hot and exquisite. You rub the soap into your reddening skin, feeling everything wash clean away. Not just the dirt and the sweat, but everything: the fear and confusion of being hunted for two days straight; the moldy tunnel under Lord's Keep; the prison; the sewers. Even your grief and guilt over Bobby's death - it doesn't go away completely, not all of it, but it's not so raw any more, not so sharp.

You dry off with a sheet pulled from the furniture. As you reach for your old clothes, Shannon stops you and holds out a dress.

"Where in the world-?" you ask.

"The Duke's wife was a little lady, just about your size, really," Shannon says. "Not beautiful, but handsome in her way. And good taste in clothes." She puts the dress into your hands.

>x dress
It's nothing fancy - a simple skirt and blouse of finespun linen, with an embroidered bodice. The sort of day dress you might see a somewhat well-to-do lady wearing to the market. It is finer than anything you've ever worn in your life. 

>wear it
You slip the dress over your head, and Shannon helps you with the laces. The linen feels soft and light on your skin. She was right about the size, too; it fits fine.

Finally, you look in the mirror. A complete stranger looks back at you: fair of skin, with dark eyes and high cheekbones. She wears fine clothes, and the tangles have been brushed out of her hair. She looks, you realize, quite pretty.

This isn't Jack anymore, you think to yourself. This is Jacqueline.

>x mirror
You can't see any such thing.

>** I could just now!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x me
With all the dirt and grime scrubbed away, you hardly look anything like the urchin you once were. You're not Jack anymore; you are Jacqueline Toresal, daughter of the Duke.

>talk to shannon
Something about this place - the stillness, the solemn expectancy - makes you reluctant to break the silence with idle chatter.

2. "Why is Dame Sandler so important?"

Chapter 9 - Preparations 

Dame Sandler looks you over and smiles. She does not seem at all surprised by your change in dress.

"Lady Jacqueline," she says, inclining her head, "how nice to see you finally looking yourself, after all these years. Come, child, let me get a look at you." She takes your chin gently between finger and thumb and tilts your face back and forth. "Hmm. You've simply destroyed your hair, of course, but there's nothing to be done now. It will grow out eventually."

1. "You knew I was a girl all along?"
2. "Widow Fiona sent me."

>1
Dame Sandler laughs, not unkindly. "Oh, child, did you really think I hadn't guessed? It's not that great a secret, you know; more people have had their eye on you than you realize. We've all been waiting for the Duke's daughter to finally make herself known, and now here you are."

1. "Who's had their eye on me?"
2. "Widow Fiona sent me."

>1
"What do you mean, 'had their eye on me'?" you say, all your old suspicions returning. "Who else knew? Who's been watching me?"

Dame Sandler sighs and her expression turns serious. "What you must realize, Jacqueline, is that you represent a threat to certain people with ambitions toward the throne. The laws of ascension in our land are quite clear: in the absence of a named successor, the ruler is determined by the will of the people."

She gives you a long, significant look. "The Duke - your father - was very popular with the common people. Baron Fossville... is not."

Your mouth goes dry, and the floor seems to tilt beneath your feet for a moment. "Are you saying..."

"Yes," says Dame Sandler. "I am saying that you have a credible claim to the throne."

1. "That's ridiculous."
2. "Is that the only reason Fossville hates me?"
3. "How would I take the throne?"

>1
You try to catch your breath, but it's all you can do to keep from bursting out into hysterical giggles. "But that's just... ridiculous," you say. "Completely ridiculous. I can't take the throne, I'm just an orphan, a street girl, a nobody..."

"You are the daughter of one of the most loved and respected noblemen in living memory," Dame Sandler says quietly. "If the Duke were alive today there is no question that he would take the Ascension if he so desired it. As his heir - even as his illegitimate heir - much of that esteem would fall to you. Many would think you worthy."

1. "Is that the only reason Fossville hates me?"
2. "How would I take the throne?"

>1
"So that's it? That's why Fossville hates me and wants to lock me away?" you ask. "Because he thinks I'll get the throne instead of him?"

Dame Sandler looks down at her hands for a long time. "There may be one other reason," she says. "Many suspect this, but few will speak of it." When she looks up at you again, you are shocked to see tears in her eyes. "Fossville may have murdered your father."

Your stomach feels as though you are falling down a deep hole, but on the outside, you are still and calm. You think you should be surprised, but somehow, you know you had been expecting this all along.

"How did he do it?" you whisper.

"Poison seems most obvious," Dame Sandler says, regaining a measure of control. "But no one really knows. There's never been any proof."

You nod. You feel anger, but it's a smoldering, far-away anger. It is something you will have to deal with later. Right now, there are too many other things you need to know.

1. "How would I take the throne?"

>1
"Even if I do have a... a credible claim to the throne," you ask, "what would I do with it? How am I supposed to take the Ascension? I can't just walk around Grubber's Market shouting, I'm the Duke's daughter, vote for me!" You think about it for a moment, then add, "Can I?"

Dame Sandler smiles. "Well, the other thing you must realize is that there are also a number of people who are interested in seeing you succeed, and who can help you press your claim. Some of them may believe that you are the better candidate; more of them simply want to spite Fossville; all of them will expect you to be appropriately grateful for their aid should you actually succeed. It is a very valuable commodity, the gratitude of a queen."

1. "I can't do this."
2. "What do I have to do?"

>1
You shake your head. "I can't do this. I can't rule a kingdom, it's... it's just insane."

Dame Sandler puts a hand on your arm. "I realize this is a bit sudden and frightening, my dear, but you must accept it and act quickly." Her voice is soothing, but firm. "This will not simply go away. Fossville does not care whether you want the Ascension. He will hunt you down regardless. So why not take him head-on? This is who you are, now. Enjoy it, play it to the hilt."

1. "What do I have to do?"

>1
You take a long, deep breath. Part of you still can't believe this is even happening. But you hear yourself saying, "All right. What do I have to do?"

"Before you can enlist anyone's aid," says Dame Sandler, "you must let it be known that you are in the game, and that you are a player worth backing. You must announce yourself. And to do that, you must attend Fossville's ball tonight."

In spite of everything that's happened, you find yourself smiling at the idea of attending a royal ball.

"Of course, you cannot attend the ball looking like this," Dame Sandler says, her tone becoming brisk and businesslike again. "You will need three things: a dress, some jewelry... and a weapon."

1. "What's wrong with the dress I have on?"
2. "Why do I need a weapon?"
3. "Where can I get some jewelry?"

>1
You look down at the dress you're wearing, the one Shannon found in Red Gate Estate.

"You mean this dress isn't good enough?" you ask, a bit hurt. "Where can I get a better one?"

Dame Sandler smiles sympathetically. "It's very nice, Jacqueline, but I'm afraid it's just a little bit out of fashion. The clothier right next door should be able to fit you with something more appropriate."

1. "How am I going to pay for this?"
2. "Why do I need a weapon?"
3. "Where can I get some jewelry?"

>1
"I appreciate your advice, Dame Sandler," you say, "but how am I going to pay for all this? I don't have any money."

"Ah, but you have something even better than money, Jacqueline," Dame Sandler says. "You have credibility. Go to the Chorus Brothers here in Lord's Market. Show them proof of your heritage, and they should be more than willing to help you with money."

1. "Why do I need a weapon?"
2. "Where can I get some jewelry?"

>1
"A weapon?" you ask. "Why do I need a weapon at a fancy ball?"

"I admit it's unlikely that Fossville would try to kill you in front of a hundred guests," Dame Sandler says drily, "but you can never be too careful. There's a weapons dealer on Commerce Street who should have what you need."

1. "Where can I get some jewelry?"

>1
"Where am I going to get some jewelry?" you ask. It occurs to you that you had a very nice necklace, but then you traded it for a cloak...

"Let me take care of that," Dame Sandler says. She unlocks the display case with a tiny silver key, lifts up the lid, and gestures to the sparkling jewels within. "Take any one you like, child. I'm one of those who would see you succeed; this is my gift to you."

>x jewels
Which do you mean, the brooch, the bracelet, the pendant or the ring?

>x brooch
The brooch is wrought of silver in the shape of a cup, symbol of the Goddess Magdalena. The stem is decorated with diamonds, and a line of sapphires adorns the cup's rim. 

>take brooch
"A fine choice," says Dame Sandler, closing and locking the case once again.

"I hardly know what to say, Dame Sandler," you breathe. "Thank you."

She merely smiles and inclines her head. "Now hurry - Fossville's ball is tonight, and there's not much time left. See the moneylenders first, then get a suitable dress and a discreet blade. Pieter will go with you-"

Pieter blinks. "What, to the ball?" he asks.

"Yes, Pieter," Sandler says pointedly, "to the ball. Just do what you always do - keep your mouth shut and make sure no one harms the valuables."

She turns back to you and smiles "Go, child, and good luck."

>x pieter
Pieter is loyal to Dame Sandler and tirelessly vigilant. You've traded friendly words with him in the past, but most of the time he stays quiet to preserve a sense of professionalism. He gives you a slight smile and nod when you catch his eye. 

>talk to pieter
"Hey Pieter," you say, "mind if I ask you something?"

"We really should be getting to the ball, Jacqueline," says Pieter gruffly, "but okay."

1. "Did you know I was a girl, too?"
2. "Do you really think I could be Queen?"
3. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
4. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
5. "What did you think of my father?"
6. "What do you know about fancy balls?"
7. "What do you know about the Chorus Brothers?"
8. "What do you know about this clothier?"
9. "What do you know about this weapon seller?"
10. "Never mind."

>1
"So did Dame Sandler keep you in the dark," you ask, "or did you know I was a girl all this time, too?"

Pieter looks so confused and uncomfortable, you have to suppress a smile. "Oh, I was in the dark, all right. To tell you the truth, it's a bit of a shock, seeing you like this... er, Jacqueline."

1. "Do you really think I could be Queen?"
2. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
3. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
4. "What did you think of my father?"
5. "What do you know about fancy balls?"
6. "What do you know about the Chorus Brothers?"
7. "What do you know about this clothier?"
8. "What do you know about this weapon seller?"
9. "Never mind."

>1
"All that stuff Dame Sandler was saying, about me having a credible claim... do you think I could really do that?" you ask. "Take the Ascension, become Queen?"

Pieter sighs. "To tell you the truth, Jacqueline - Goddesses, but it's weird calling you that - to tell you the truth, I don't know much about Royal politics at all. But if Dame Sandler says you have a chance at it, then I'd guess that you do. It wouldn't be the most far-fetched thing I ever heard that turned out to be true."

1. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What did you think of my father?"

7. "What do you know about this weapon seller?"
8. "Never mind."

>1
"What do you think of Dame Sandler?" you ask.

"She took me in when no one else would hire me," says Pieter, "on account of some bad business that happened back east, and don't bother asking about it by the way. She's the shrewdest, toughest, fairest woman I ever met. I'd lay down my life for that lady. And if she wants you protected, then by the Goddesses you'll have nothing to fear from anyone."

1. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
2. "What did you think of my father?"

6. "What do you know about this weapon seller?"
7. "Never mind."

"What do you think of Baron Fossville?" you ask.

"Don't you worry about Baron Fossville," growls Pieter through clenched teeth. "That bastard's going to get what's coming to him. For Bobby and for your father."

1. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
2. "What did you think of my father?"

6. "What do you know about this weapon seller?"
7. "Never mind."

>2
"I guess you remember when my father ruled the city," you remark. "What did you think of him, Pieter?"

"I thought he was a just ruler," Pieter says. "I'd have had him for king gladly, if he were still alive. You could do worse for a father, Jacqueline. And I suppose he could have done worse for a daughter," he adds with a smile.

1. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about fancy balls?"
4. "What do you know about the Chorus Brothers?"
5. "What do you know about this clothier?"
6. "What do you know about this weapon seller?"
7. "Never mind."

>3
"Well, Pieter, you ever been to a fancy dress ball, before?" you ask. "What can we expect?"

Pieter spreads his hands in a shrug. "I'm afraid I won't be much help, Jacqueline - I'm not very comfortable at parties. Dame Sandler said you're just supposed to socialize, let people know who you are. 'Make yourself visible,' she said. Whatever that means."

1. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What did you think of my father?"
4. "What do you know about the Chorus Brothers?"
5. "What do you know about this clothier?"
6. "What do you know about this weapon seller?"
7. "Never mind."

>4
"So what do you know about these moneylenders, the Chorus Brothers?" you ask.

"Those two hear nothing but the clink of coin," grumbles Pieter. "They'll lend you money quick enough as long as they think they'll get some return out of it. I'd rather not do business with them at all, to be honest, but Dame Sandler says you need their backing."

1. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What did you think of my father?"
4. "What do you know about fancy balls?"
5. "What do you know about this clothier?"
6. "What do you know about this weapon seller?"
7. "Never mind."

>5
"What do you know about this clothier at the Royal Tunic?" you ask.

Pieter rolls his eyes shrugs. "I'm a lifelong bachelor, Jacqueline. What I know about a lady's clothes you could fit into a thimble and have room left over."

1. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What did you think of my father?"
4. "What do you know about fancy balls?"
5. "What do you know about the Chorus Brothers?"
6. "What do you know about this weapon seller?"
7. "Never mind."

>6
"Have you ever done business with this weapon seller Dame Sandler mentioned?" you ask.

Pieter snorts. "That'd be Olgan Minor. He's nothing more than a dim thug. He'll try to intimidate you because you're young and a girl, but there's nothing behind his threats. Let me do the talking and we'll get your weapon soon enough."

1. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What did you think of my father?"

"Never mind, it wasn't important," you say.

"All right," says Pieter, unperturbed.

Sandler & Sons Jeweler
The inside of this store is tasteful but austerely decorated, perhaps to better draw the eye towards the glass display case in the center of the room and the king's ransom in jewelry contained therein. You can leave to the west.

Pieter is here, looking around warily.

Dame Sandler stands near the central display case. A small, dignified smile plays on her lips.

>x dame
Though in her elder years, Dame Sandler is still a tall and striking woman. Her long, silver hair is pulled back in a complicated bun, and she has a habit of inspecting her merchandise through a monocle on the end of a long, slender, gold-filigreed handle. Sometimes you wonder what she's doing running a shop (even such a relatively high-class one as this); her demeanor is more that of an aristocrat, if not full royalty.

Although you almost never come to her shop (everything in here is too expensive to buy and too well-guarded to nick), for some reason Dame Sandler has always taken a liking to you, and never runs you out when you visit, even when she has important customers to tend to. It's more of a bemused curiosity than real affection, but feels good to be on a friendly basis with such an intriguing woman. 

>out
As you leave, Dame Sandler calls out, "Good luck, Lady Jacqueline."

Pieter hurries to catch up, his hand on his sword hilt.

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south. 

Pieter is here, fingering his sword hilt.

>se
Pieter sticks close to you, looking around warily.


Chorus Brothers
The inside of this shop is dark - dark wood paneling on the walls; deep, wine-dark carpeting on the floor; even a pair of huge, leather armchairs over in one corner. The back half of the room is hidden behind a wall of reinforced wood, with a wide window cut through the center.

Pieter is here, muttering to himself.

A moment after you enter, two faces suddenly appear at the window, each seeming to slide smoothly in from either side. They look at you with identical expressions of curiosity and a sort of mild, almost professional contempt.

"Good afternoon," says one.

"May we help you?" asks the other.

1. "I need a loan."
2. "What was Fossville doing here yesterday?"

>2
Suddenly you remember running into Baron Fossville - literally - yesterday morning. "I saw Baron Fossville leaving here yesterday," you mention casually. "He seemed pretty upset. Was there some problem with his credentials?"

One of the brothers makes a show of inspecting his fingernails while the other clears his throat. "We have the utmost..." one of them begins.

"...respect for Baron Fossville," continues the other. "However, he presents certain..."

"...liabilities. Let us leave it at that."

1. "I have a question."

>1
"I have a question," you tell the two brothers.

They nod in perfect, synchronized unison. "Allow us to answer..." says one.

"...to the best of our ability," finishes the other.

1. "I need a loan."
2. "What was Fossville doing here yesterday?"

>1
"I, er... I need a loan," you say, not at all sure how this sort of business is conducted. "You know, money."

A pair of condescending smiles, perfectly identical and simultaneous, appear on the brothers' faces.

"My dear," begins one, "you certainly look respectable, but without..."

"...some form of credentials..." adds the other.

"...our hands are tied," finishes the first.

1. "What kind of credentials do you need?"

>1
"What counts as credentials?" you ask. "What do you need to see?"

"Ah, well then," says one, "some form of collateral perhaps, or someone to act as surety..."

"...even a letter, establishing your social standing. In short, anything that..."

"...would help assure us that we were making..."

"...a sound investment."

1. "I have a question."
2. "Will this letter work?"

>2
"Will this work as credentials?" you ask, holding out the Duke's letter.

The brothers both reach out, one with his right hand, the other with his left, and delicately take the letter from you. Their eyes flicker back and forth in unison as they scan the words. When they reach the end, four identical eyebrows shoot up. "How very..."

"...interesting. It would seem you are a personage of more..."

"...importance than first we assumed."

They hand the letter back to you, smiling, and ask in chorus, "How may we help you?"

"I, er... I need a loan," you say, not at all sure how this sort of business is conducted. "You know, money."

The two brothers lean forward eagerly, as though they've been waiting for you to ask.

"We would be delighted to extend to you..."

"...our most prestigious line of credit!"

Over the next few minutes they hand you dozens of sheets of paper covered in dense, tiny script, full of bizarre words like amortization, compound interest, and escrow. Pieter tries to read some of it, with his brow furrowed up and his lips moving slightly; eventually he shakes his head and mutters, "Just sign all of them." You dutifully write your name where the brothers show you.

After it's all done, they sweep all the papers into a slim leather folder, and place a small purse of coins on the counter. "That's it?" complains Pieter, but when you tug open the drawstring, you see the sunlight gleam of gold.

"When you have secured your position, please remember us..." says one brother.

"...not merely as your creditors..."

"...but as your friends."

And both brothers smile in unison, revealing two sets of wide, white teeth.

"Come back soon," intones one of the brothers as you leave. "Your business is..."

"...always welcome," finishes the other.

Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the tasteful shopfronts.

Pieter is here, looking around warily.

>ne
Pieter hurries to catch up, his hand on his sword hilt.

A small bell above the door tinkles as you enter, and a man comes rushing out of the store's back room with a measuring cord in his hands, held up as though ready to begin fitting you immediately. When he sees that you are a clean, respectable, and evidently well-to-do young lady, he practically squeals with delight, clapping his hands and plucking at the fabric of your clothes with soft, nimble fingers.

Royal Tunic
The walls are hung with tasteful curtains, and a deep, soft carpet covers the floor. Several clothier's dummies stand about the room, displaying gorgeous formal court apparel for both men and women. The street lies west.

Pieter is here, keeping a close eye on you.

The clothier hovers nearby, waiting to serve.

>talk to clothier
"I have a question..." you start to say.

"And I have answers," says the clothier, bowing deeply. "Please, dear, ask away."

1. "What's your cheapest dress?"
2. "What would be good to wear to the ball?"
3. "What do you think of Fossville and the Ascension?"

>3
"What do you think about the Ascension coming up?" you ask. "Do you think Baron Fossville has a chance?"

The clothier raises one (plucked, you suspect) eyebrow. "Listen honey," he says, "I know dresses. That's all I know. Well, it's not all I know. But it's all I'm willing to talk about. Don't mix business with pleasure, and don't mix dresses with politics. That's my motto and I'm sticking to it."

1. "What's your cheapest dress?"
2. "What would be good to wear to the ball?"

>2
"I'm, um... well, actually I'm going to be attending Fossville's ball tonight," you say, still a bit giddy at the idea. "And I need something to wear. What would you suggest?"

The clothier scoffs and rolls his eyes. "Sister, there's no point in even choosing. They're all good. In fact, I guarantee that if you wear one of my dresses to the ball, no one is going to take their eyes off you. If you manage to find someone who is not treating you like the absolute center of their universe, come back here, and I'll give you a full refund."

1. "What's your cheapest dress?"
2. "Okay, how about... that one?"

>2
After several agonizing minutes of indecision, you point to the dress you want.

The clothier flutters his hands and practically giggles, "Oh, a splendid choice! You'll look like a princess!" He dances around you, taking measurements with his cord and muttering numbers to himself as he goes. Then he takes the dress off its dummy and retreats with it into the back of his shop. "This will be just a moment," he calls over his shoulder.

You look at Pieter and shrug.

"Er, I'll wait outside," he says.

And afterwards, as you look at yourself in the full-length mirror while the clothier kneels at your feet, tugging, plucking, pinning, making adjustments, you realize that he was right - you do look like a princess.

The clothier wanders over to one of the dresses on display and fusses with the neckline.

>x mirror
In the clothier's tall, floor-length mirror, you can see yourself from head to toe. 

It's kind of embarassing, but you really do look like a princess.

>look in mirror

It's kind of embarassing, but you really do look like a princess.

"I have a question..." you start to say.

"And I have answers," says the clothier, bowing deeply. "Please, dear, ask away."

1. "What's your cheapest dress?"
2. "What do you think?"

>2
"You really think this will be all right?" you ask, looking down at the beautiful gown you're now wearing.

"It's fabulous," raves the clothier. "It's you. Trust me".

The clothier inspects his fingernails.

1. "What's your cheapest dress?"

>1
"Can you show me one of your cheaper dresses?" you ask, thinking yourself quite shrewd.

The clother sniffs. "If you want to look cheap, you can buy something from that hussy who runs the silk tent in Grubber's. The question you have to ask yourself, honey, is how much is it worth to you to look fabulous."

You nod, silently wishing you could sink through the floor.

1. "What do you think?"

>out
"Come back soon, sweetie," calls the clothier as you leave.

Pieter is here, looking around warily.

Pieter blinks and does a double take as you step out onto the sidewalk in your new finery. "Wow," he stammers. "You look... different. I mean, you looked good before, er, with the other dress, I mean, but this is... wow." He blushes, then grins, then shakes his head. "Come on, Lady Toresal. We still have much to do."

>** He said "come back soon, sweetie" before, when he thought I was just a street urchin. It seems incongruous he should say the same thing now and hten
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>talk to pieter
"Hey Pieter," you say, "mind if I ask you something?"

"I don't know if I have any answers for you, Jac- er, Jacqueline," says Pieter gruffly, "but okay."

1. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
2. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
3. "What did you think of my father?"
4. "What do you know about fancy balls?"

"We've got what we need from those moneylenders," Pieter said, "I'd just as soon stay out of their clutches for now."

"No," says Pieter, pulling you back. "You'll not be going back to Maiden House any time soon. That's exactly where Fossville will expect you to go."

Pieter follows, doggedly keeping you in sight.

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

Pieter is here, muttering to himself.

>w
Pieter hurries after you, his hand on his sword hilt.

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs east to west, between Grubber's Market and Lord's Market. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east. 

Pieter is here, keeping a close eye on you.

"We're not here for food," Pieter says. "We have more important things to worry about."

Pieter follows, doggedly keeping you in sight.

Armory
The tangy smell of oiled steel is nearly overpowering in this small, windowless shop. All of the really interesting weapons - axes, flails, spiked gauntlets and the like - are high up on racks on the back wall, well behind the high counter. However, there is a display of assorted knives and daggers sitting out where you can get a close look at them.

The proprietor makes a face as you walk into his shop, but when he sees Pieter behind you he quickly finds something else to look at.

>talk to proprietor
"Don't waste your breath making conversation, Jacqueline," Pieter says. "Just pick something and buy it and let's move on." You get the impression that Pieter really doesn't like Olgan Minor, and that maybe there's a history between the two.

Olgan Minor, the proprietor, leans against the counter, watching you intently.

>take dagger
"Touch one of those  and-"

"Shut your trap, Minor," snaps Pieter, and Minor falls silent and even takes a step or two back. "Hurry up and buy something, Jacqueline," Pieter says.

>buy dagger
Pieter leans over your shoulder as you inspect the daggers. "Having the right weapon is as important as knowing what to do with it," he tells you. "You don't want big or fancy; you want something sharp, long enough to do damage to a man when you stick him with it, but small enough to hide under your, er..." he suddenly blushes and clears his throat. "Anyway. That one," he says, pointing to a plain-handled blade about six inches long. "That's the one you want."

Olgan Minor grumbles, but Pieter glares at him again and suggests that if your gold is no good here, then perhaps some other metal might suit the shopkeeper better. Grudgingly, Minor hands over the knife, and makes a show of biting your gold coin to make sure of its worth.

You slip the knife under your gown. Already you feel more confident.

>out
Pieter sticks close to you, looking around warily.

You leave the weapons shop with a sense of relief.

Evening is falling over the city, and the streets are clearing of people.

"The ball at Lord's Keep will be starting soon," mutters Pieter. "We'd better hurry!"

Pieter follows, his hand on his sword hilt.

Grubber's Market
At night, the normally crowded marketplace is an empty maze of shadows, abandoned stalls and rolled-up canvas. The Lord's Road lies north, and Commerce Street lies back east.

Pieter is here, shifting his feet impatiently.

"Don't worry," Pieter mutters, as much to himself as to you. "I won't let anything happen to you." 

>e
Pieter hurries to catch up, doggedly keeping you in sight.

Commerce Street
Commerce Street at night is eerily quiet and empty. Your footsteps seem to echo on the cobbles as you walk past the shuttered shopfronts. 

Pieter is here, muttering to himself.

"We don't have time to go traipsing around the city," says Pieter. "We need to get to Fossville's ball."

Pieter hurries to catch up, his hand on his sword hilt.

Lord's Road
The wide and well-paved Lord's Road runs from Grubber's Market straight north to Lord's Keep, a mile or so from the city. To the east are rolling pastures; to the west, broken ground and scrub.

Pieter is here, looking around warily.

>w
There's nothing in that direction but rocks and the occasional thornbush.

>x rocks
The land to the west of Lord's Road is rocky and dry, no good for growing much of anything other than thornbushes.

Southern Gate
The Lord's Road ends here at the keep's southern gate. Tonight, for the ball, the portcullis is raised; however, the guards are on high alert tonight, checking invitations as each guest arrives.

Pieter is here, muttering to himself.

>x guards
The guards are wearing polished mail underneath tabards decorated with the Toresal coat of arms, and carrying long spears. They look alert and ready for trouble. 

>n
The guards won't let you in unless you have an official invitation. The way things are going lately, they might well be looking out for you specifically.

Pasture
This wide, open field is used by the city for tourneys and other holiday events, or by cattle-sellers driving their livestock to market. Tonight it is empty except for the occasional cow pie. To the north you can see the dark, rough edge of a forest.

Pieter is here, keeping a close eye on you.

Pieter looks around warily.

>n
Pieter hurries to catch up, his hand on his sword hilt.

Stream Crossing
A small stream bubbles out of the woods and cuts through the pasture's north end. The edge of the forest lies to the north, just across the water. The city is far away to the south.

Pieter is here, muttering to himself.

Pieter fingers his sword hilt, as though expecting an ambush from any quarter.

>n
Now that you've had a bit of practice, you're a bit more confident on the rocks this time. Carefully lifting your skirts (you're still getting used to moving around in a dress), you pick your way over the stream with little difficulty.

Pieter, on the other hand, stumbles halfway across and lurches into the water, soaking his trousers up to the knee. You do your best to stifle your laughter as he sloshes his way to shore, cursing and grumbling something about "gratitude" and "youth today."

Woods
You are in the woodlands just southeast of Lord's Keep, following the game trails that wind their way through strands of pale birch and black spruce. There is just enough moonlight trickling through the upper branches to see your way by.

Pieter is here, looking around warily.

The game trails criss-cross through the woods in every direction, and they all look the same. When you were here the night before, Bobby quickly found a shortcut to the clearing. Where was it?

>x sapling
You search the underbrush carefully. At first it all looks the same, but after several tense minutes... you find it! The split sapling that Bobby showed you last night, right next to a trail leading west.

>w
Clearing
The woods open out here in a small, moonlit clearing. The ruins of an old pavilion lie here, pale pavestones poking up like bones from the grass.

In the center of the clearing stands a crumbling fountain, topped by a cracked statue of the Goddess Brigid.

>x pavilion
Whatever once stood here was probably very beautiful. Now it's just rubble in the grass. 

Pieter shifts his feet impatiently. "We need to be on our way," he mutters. "The ball starts soon."

>x statue
The statue's features are worn away and obscured by moss, but you've seen enough statues of Brigid to know that she's almost always depicted carrying water. She cradles her urn like a child, tipping it gently over the bowl of the fountain. 

>x urn
The urn is hollow, and probably had water flowing out of it when the fountain worked.

Looking closely, you notice a small metal bolt sticking out of the bottom of the urn. 

>x metal bolt
Just a little knob of metal, sticking out of the bottom of the urn. 

>pull knob
The knob doesn't move that way. It feels like you could press it in, though.

Pieter looks around warily.

>push knob
The metal knob pushes in, then pops out again with a click. Suddenly there is a deep, solid thunk, and a scraping sound coming from the stone beneath you. Just as it did before, part of the statue's base swings inward.

Pieter raises his eyebrows. "Huh," he says, "I never knew about that."

>d
Pieter sticks close to you, looking around warily.

Underneath The Fountain
The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.

Pieter is here, shifting his feet impatiently.

>show fungus to pieter
(first taking the white fungus)
Just the thought of touching the sticky fungus makes you shudder.

Pieter fingers his sword hilt.

>n
Ducking your head to avoid the low ceiling, you follow the tunnel for some distance.

Pieter follows, his hand on his sword hilt.

Tunnel End
The tunnel ends here at a blank, stone wall.

Pieter is here, muttering to himself.

>x wall
Carefully, you run your fingertips across the wall, trying to remember where Bobby found the loose brick the last time you were here.

Ah-ha! You find it - the faint outline of a rectangular hole, with a brick resting loosely in the gap.

>pull brick
You manage to get your fingers in around the edge of the brick and pull it out.

>x wakk
You can't see any such thing.

>x wall
It's just a blank, featureless, stone wall... except for the rough, rectangular hole where one of the bricks is missing.  

>x hole
In the back of the hole you see a short lever.

>pull lever
The lever moves slightly, then snaps back with a click. The wall swings away, revealing shadows beyond.

Pieter looks impressed. "You're full of secrets and surprises, aren't you?" You can't bring yourself to tell him that you learned all your secrets from Bobby.

>x shadows
You can't see any such thing.

>** Apparently I can now
I didn't understand that sentence.

>n
Pieter sticks close to you, looking around warily.

Chapel
The chapel of the Goddesses is a spacious, octagonal room, empty of furniture. The wood-paneled walls glow warmly, reflecting the light from dozens of devotional candles; the high ceiling disappears in the shadows overhead. A corridor leads southwest, and a secret passage in the south wall leads into subterranean gloom.

Pieter is here, keeping a close eye on you.

Pieter stands close to you protectively.

Lower Bailey
The lower bailey has been cleaned, with gravel spread over the larger mud puddles. Guests to the ball are still trickling in from the south. The doors to the inner keep stand open to the north, and music and laughter drift out into the evening air. You can enter another part of the castle to the northeast.

Pieter is here, keeping a close eye on you.

>up
Climbing up to the upper bailey would only attract unwanted attention. The ball is where you need to be.

>n
Pieter hurries to catch up, looking around warily.

Foyer
The entrance hall has been decorated for the occasion, its stark, stone walls hidden behind festive tapestries and garlands. A few guests stand around in groups, chatting, but the main event seems to be in the ballroom, north of here.

Pieter is here, fingering his sword hilt.

>x guests
The guests are all the brightest, richest, and most beautiful in Toresal. They laugh and chatter and compliment each other on their extravagant costumes and jewelry. Amidst all the gaeity and ostentatious wealth, you can't help but feel a little bit self-conscious and plain. 

>x garlands
The garlands add a touch of festive greenery to the room. 

"Are you sure you know the way?" Pieter mutters.

>** This question seems strangely inappropriate now that we've arrived!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x tapestries
The tapestries depict important battles in the history of Miradania, noblemen leading their soldiers into war against the western clans. You see a number of coats-of-arms represented in the battle scenes. Interestingly, Fossville's is not among them. 

Pieter stands close to you protectively.

>look behind them
You find nothing of interest.

>save
Ok.

>n
You step into a world of light...

Ballroom
Hundreds of candles spread an unearthly golden glow throughout the hall. From massive chandeliers dripping with crystal, from golden candelabras ensconced in the walls, the multitude of flames flicker like stars. The ballroom is packed with people; all of Toresal's high society seems to be here tonight, and still the enormous hall does not seem full. Servants navigate through the crowds, carrying silver platters loaded with pastries and canapés. Somewhere, a string quartet is playing a lively concerto.

It's breathtaking. It's every fantasy of beauty and riches that you ever dreamed of, brought to life.

>listen
The constant wave of voices, conversations, laughter, and music is overwhelming.

>x quartet
Somewhere over in the far corner of the ballroom, a string quartet is playing stately chamber music. 

>x chandeliers
The chandeliers are enormous sculptures of dangling crystal, glittering with candlelight. 

"Well now, look who we have here," says a gruff voice behind you. "You must be the girl my son helped out of prison recently." You turn and are startled to see a familiar face - it's Jacobs, your former cellmate from the jailhouse!

Then you realize - no, it's not him. This man has the same heavy brow and hulking build, but he's older, more jowly, and his hair is gray at the temples. This must be Jacobs' father, the wealthy and notorious merchant.

1. "It was the other way around, actually."
2. "And how is your son lately?"
3. "How do you know who I am?"

>1
What would Dame Sandler do in this situation? you wonder. You decide to play it cool and tricky. "Funny," you say. "I remember it was me who helped your son out of prison."

He holds up a pudgy, ring-encrusted hand. "Don't bother denying it, I have informants everywhere. I know exactly who you are... and why you were in a prison cell." Jacobs laughs. "Don't worry, I've no plans to reveal your presence to Fossville."

1. "I thought you were a crook."
2. "Then what do you want?"

>2
"If you're not here to blow the whistle on me, then what do you want?" you ask.

Jacobs the Elder smiles and leans close to you, close enough that you can smell the spiced wine on his breath. "The way I see it, you owe my son quite a favor," he murmurs in your ear. "The way I see it, you'll be owing many people favors before you're done. But if you're to start off well, you'll need to know who those people are.

"Over there for example, is the Queen," Jacobs says, pointing across the room to a woman you can barely see for all the servants and courtiers pressed around her. "She knows who you are, too. Best to not cross her path tonight, though I doubt you'll get close enough even if you try."

He points out a beautiful young woman who seems to be deliberately ignoring the fact that you're staring at her. "And there's her daughter, working the room," he says. "She's Fossville's quarry tonight, but every warm-blooded male with an ounce of ambition will be trying to woo her anyway."

Slowly, Jacobs turns you full circle, pointing out notable guests as they come into view. "The Duke and Duchess of Inhyron, in the Seven Lakes region. An old family, very influential. Insufferably snobbish, as well, but at least they liked your father. And there's the Baron and Baroness of Amhyron. You'll like them; they're a bit less formal, and less likely to hold your lack of upbringing against you. On the other hand, they are utterly beholden to the Inhyron Duchy. Then there's the Earl of Bresa," Jacobs sighs. "A merchant lord from the Kozar Delta. A foolish man with a purchased title. He has all the money in the world, but no power, because he is utterly indiscriminate in how he spends it."

He turns back to you. "Those are the players of the game in this room, and you will have to spar with all of them if you want to win."

1. "Why are you telling me this?"
2. "But what do I have to do?"

>1
"I still don't understand," you say. "Why are you telling me this? Why are you helping me?"

Jacobs the Elder shrugs. "I'll be frank," he says, "you're a long shot. I don't blame you for trying to capitalize on your father's legacy, but you must know that your chances of doing so successfully are next to zero. Still, I didn't get to be where I am today without laying a few coins down on the occasional dark horse. A bit of free advice is no skin off my nose, and maybe you'll remember it if, by some outside whim of the Goddesses, you actually get somewhere."

1. "But what do I have to do?"

>1
"But how do I 'win?'" you ask, feeling a bit lost. "What am I supposed to say to these people?"

Jacobs puts his hand on your arm. "The bottom line, my dear girl, is this: unless you have an army at your beck and call, which you clearly do not, you cannot take the throne by yourself. It's all about how many allies you have, and there is only one way to bring people over to your side. It doesn't matter if they like you; it doesn't even matter if they think you'd make a good Queen. All that matters is whether they think you'll repay them well if they help you."

Suddenly he claps you on the back in a most uncourtly manner. "Well, that should be enough to get you started. Good luck, my girl." And he wanders off, chuckling, to mingle with the other guests.

The Earl of Bresa, the Baron of Amhyron, the Duke and Duchess of Inhyron, the Princess and Jacobs the Elder are elsewhere in the crowd.

>talk to earl
"Ah-HA!" Earl Bresa roars when he spots you. "The young up-and-comer! The stick in the spokes! The crumb in everyone's eye!" He seems utterly unconcerned that anyone else might hear him - although it seems like most of the other guests are making an effort to ignore him anyway. "Listen," he says, putting his hand on your arm. "I like you already. You need anything, backing, whatever, you just let me know. Now, what was it you wanted to talk about?"

1. "You're willing to support me?"
2. "What can you tell me about Baron Fossville?"
3. "What can you tell me about my father?"
4. "What do you think about Jacobs the Elder?"
5. "What can you tell me about the Queen?"
6. "What do you think about the Princess?"
7. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
8. "What do you think of the Baron of Amhyron?"

>1
"You mean you're willing to support me?" you ask, taken aback. "Just like that? Without knowing anything about me?"

"Young lady," the Earl slurs, "I know one thing about you and one thing only, and it is the only thing I need to know: that you are an insufferable aggravation to nearly every influential person at this Goddess-forsaken party. And that makes you all right by me."

1. "Don't you want anything in return?"
2. "What can you tell me about Baron Fossville?"
3. "What can you tell me about my father?"
4. "What do you think about Jacobs the Elder?"

"I don't want to seem ungrateful," you say, "but that seems like a strange reason to support anyone for the Ascension. Don't you want anything in return?

The Earl flaps his hand dismissively. "Bah! What I want is good food and strong wine, and that I can buy. Why get involved in politics? Why break my back trying to curry favor with a pack of throne-sniffing hyenas who all hate me anyway? But you can stick in their craws in a way that I cannot, and for that, I will gladly back you."

8. "Good-bye."

"Can you tell me anything about Baron Fossville?" you ask.

"Fossville? A mere scarecrow, a wooden soldier, a coward." rants the Earl. "You know, they say he poisoned the old Duke. Er..." he wipes his mouth with his sleeve to hide his embarassment. "Sorry to bring that up. My condolences and all that. But it wouldn't surprise me a bit if it were true. It would serve the Queen right to have that conniving weasel for a son-in-law."

8. "Good-bye."

"Did you know my father well?" you ask.

The Earl becomes sober for a rare moment. "There was no finer man in the kingdom than your father, my girl" he says, putting his greasy hand on your arm. "He was the one man I respected out of all of these stuffed peacocks. No one was his equal. Certainly not Fossville. Certainly not any of the backstabbing dandies parading around this room tonight."

1. "What can you tell me about Baron Fossville?"

"What do you think about Jacobs the Elder?" you ask. "He doesn't seem to have a very high opinion of you."

"Why should I care what that self-inflated stallkeeper thinks of me?" yells the Earl, deliberately pitching his voice so that Jacobs, standing in a nearby corner of the room, can hear. "He's just jealous of my title, is all."

1. "What can you tell me about Baron Fossville?"

8. "Good-bye."

"What can you tell me about the Queen?" you ask.

"Bah, the Queen's been all but useless ever since the King died," the Earl says loudly, ignoring all the horrified stares. "Now she's just desperate to remain relevant."

1. "What can you tell me about Baron Fossville?"
2. "What can you tell me about my father?"

"What do you think about the Princess?" you ask.

The Earl gets a foolish grin on his face. "Oh, she's a pretty thing, all right. I wouldn't mind marrying her myself, if it didn't mean moving in with her hungry old hag of a mother." Then he opens his mouth and lets loose a long, ripping belch, as if to emphasize which features the young Princess might find most attractive.

"What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?" you ask.

"Oh, what a noble and proper gentleman is the Duke of Inhyron," intones the Earl in grave tones. Then he throws back his head and roars, "Balderdash! What a noble and proper heap of cow pies, more like! Always strutting about his precious lineages. He hates me, you know, because I'm 'low-born' - which just means I earned my money the hard way instead of inheriting it from Mummy and Daddy - and even so I'm richer than he is. I flaunt it just to rub his pointy little nose in it."

He leans close and "whispers" loudly enough for guests over by the chamber orchestra to hear, "Between you and me, I think the great Duke protests too much. Anyone that obsessed with bloodlines probably has something in his own that he'd rather people not know about."

8. "Good-bye."

>7
"What do you think of the Baron of Amhyron?" you ask.

"Amhyron's a decent bloke," grunts the Earl, "but he's got no backbone. He lets Duke Inhyron pull his strings like a puppet, and he never says one word against it. He says he puts up with it for the good of his subjects, but really he's just afraid to make waves. He ought to stand up to the Duke for once in his life; it'd do him good."

The ballroom is packed with people; all of Toresal's high society seems to be here tonight, and still the enormous hall does not seem full. Servants navigate through the crowds, carrying silver platters loaded with pastries and canapés. Somewhere, a string quartet is playing a lively concerto.

The Earl of Bresa, the Baron of Amhyron, the Duke and Duchess of Inhyron, the Princess and Jacobs the Elder are elsewhere in the crowd.

You can't see any such thing.

>** They're on the silver platters, carried by the servants
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

I didn't understand that sentence.

>listen to quartet
Somewhere over in the far corner of the ballroom, a string quartet is playing stately chamber music. 

>talk to duke
Duke Inhyron inclines his head as you approach. "No need for introductions," he says sternly. "I am aware of who you are, and I see no reason to incriminate either of us by announcing it." He looks you up and down with only a slight squint of disapproval. "Your father was a good ruler and a good man," he says, "and though I do not think you have what it takes to fill his shoes, he was a friend, and you are his kin. So there we are. What would you ask of me, girl?"

1. "You don't like me very much, do you?"
2. "You were a friend of my father?"
3. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
4. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
5. "What do you know about the Queen?"
6. "What do you think about the Princess?"
7. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
8. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"

>1
"I get the impression that you don't like me very much," you say, making an effort to stay polite and unruffled. "Would you care to tell me why?"

The Duke gives a short, exasperated sigh. "Very well. I do not feel it is appropriate for you to pursue the Ascension given the... circumstances surrounding your birth. I am not partisan; I have no personal stake in who is chosen to take the throne. However, there are proper, traditional methods for going about it. I would see your father's memory honored properly. If you can convince me that coming out publicly as his illegitimate heir for political gain would somehow not besmirch his family name, then I might be persuaded to look more favorably on your endeavors."

1. "You were a friend of my father?"
2. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
3. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
4. "What do you know about the Queen?"
5. "What do you think about the Princess?"
6. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
7. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
8. "Good-bye."

>1
"You were a friend of my father?" you ask. You find it hard to believe that your father would have been friendly with this stuck-up chauvinist.

"I counted your father as a friend and an equal," says the Duke. "It pained me to learn of his moral lapse, but none of us are perfect, I suppose. What's done is done, and I do not judge him."

1. "Don't you know Fossville murdered my father?"
2. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
3. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
4. "What do you know about the Queen?"
5. "What do you think about the Princess?"
6. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
7. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
8. "Good-bye."

>1
Unable to keep the acid tone out of your voice, you ask, "It doesn't bother you that Fossville murdered my father?"

The Duke looks a bit uncomfortable. "There is no evidence that he did any such thing," he says finally. "Only malicious rumors spread by the Baron's political enemies. Among which, I feel compelled to point out, you now number yourself. You must admit, it would be very convenient for you if it became widely believed that Baron Fossville is a murderer, whether or not such a thing were actually true." He smiles infuriatingly and spreads his hands. "I am merely trying to remain objective. It would be irresponsible of me to not take these things into consideration."

1. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
2. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about the Queen?"
4. "What do you think about the Princess?"
5. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
6. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
7. "Good-bye."

>1
"What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?" you ask.

The Duke gives you a look of withering contempt. "Jacobs is a common gangster. I'm having difficulty imagining how a conversation about him could possibly be fruitful."

1. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
2. "What do you know about the Queen?"
3. "What do you think about the Princess?"
4. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
5. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
6. "Good-bye."

>1
"What do you know about Baron Fossville?" you ask.

"Fossville can be a bit uncouth, I admit, but he has good breeding," the Duke says. "I've no specific reason to think that he wouldn't be a good candidate for the Ascension, although I am open to the possibility of alternatives."

1. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
2. "What do you know about the Queen?"
3. "What do you think about the Princess?"
4. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
5. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
6. "Good-bye."

>2
"What do you know about the Queen?" you ask.

"I have the utmost regard for Her Majesty," says the Duke, glancing over at the woman, "and I respect her judgment. I expect that her opinion and my own are in accordance on many things, particularly with regard to the Ascension. Which is not to say that she and I have never disagreed, but it would take a strong argument to convince me that she was wrong."

1. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
2. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you think about the Princess?"
4. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
5. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
6. "Good-bye."

>3
"What do you think about the Princess?" you ask.

The Duke smiles. "She is a fine young lady, with the most respectable of bloodlines, obviously. My own son has only just turned nine; otherwise I myself would be petitioning on his behalf for the Princess's hand."

1. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
2. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about the Queen?"
4. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
5. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
6. "You say you have a son?"
7. "Good-bye."

>4
"What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?" you ask.

"My grandfather granted the Baron's grandfather his title and lands more than half a century ago," the Duke informs you. "Since then, the Amhyrons have fulfilled their vassal obligations more than adequately. I sometimes fear that the Baron is too lenient with his subjects, especially in the area of moral guidance, but that is his own concern. So long as the King's Law is enforced and taxes are levied, I am content to merely set an example and allow others to emulate it as they see fit."

1. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
2. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about the Queen?"
4. "What do you think about the Princess?"
5. "Why don't you let Baron Amhyron follow his own interests?"
6. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
7. "You say you have a son?"
8. "Good-bye."

>5
"According to Jacobs, you won't let the Baron sneeze without your say-so," you remark. "Is it really necessary to keep him so beholden to you? Why don't you let him follow his own interests?"

The Duke stiffens, clearly furious at the idea of someone like Jacobs (or even, you realize, someone like you) gossiping about him. "The traditions of vassalage are ancient and intricately bound to concepts of honor and moral duty, so it does not surprise me that Jacobs has such a poor understanding of them," he snaps. "But fundamental to this tradition is the idea of loyalty. Without loyalty, we are all weakened. If you cannot grasp that, then I have little optimism for your chances for the throne."

1. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
2. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about the Queen?"
4. "What do you think about the Princess?"
5. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
6. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
7. "You say you have a son?"
8. "Good-bye."

>6
"What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?" you ask.

"The Earl of Bresa is a sterling example of what happens when material wealth is divorced from proper family lineage," sniffs the Duke. "People of his class were never meant to wield power, and have no idea how to properly do so."

1. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
2. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about the Queen?"
4. "What do you think about the Princess?"
5. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
6. "You say you have a son?"
7. "Good-bye."

>6
"Do I understand correctly Your Grace, that you have a young son?" you ask.

The Duke puffs himself up. "That's right. He'll be ten years old come this autumn, and already he is a strapping lad, a credit to his bloodline."

1. "I might be willing to marry him."
2. "Well, keep him away from me."

>1
Choosing your words carefully, you say, "Since bloodlines are so important to you, I'm sure you're aware of the advantages of marrying into a Royal one. If I win the Ascension, I could make that happen for you."

The Duke, for once, looks speechless.

You clear your throat and hurry on. "Think about it, Your Grace. The Princess strikes me as someone who would be very particular about whom she married, but I won't have the luxury of being picky. Of course, I am illegitimate... but I'd still be the Queen. And that's what really matters, right?"

The Duke stares at you for a long time, then gives a short, curt bow. "I will remember that," he says, then turns stiffly and strides away. His wife scurries after him.

You take a deep breath and try to swallow the nasty taste in your mouth. You've just promised to marry the nine-year-old son of a conceited, condescending bigot. But that might just make the difference when it's time for the Duke to decide whom he's going to support for the Ascension.

You have a feeling that Dame Sandler would be pleased. You're not exactly sure that makes you happy.

Ballroom
Hundreds of candles spread an unearthly golden glow throughout the hall. From massive chandeliers dripping with crystal, from golden candelabras ensconced in the walls, the multitude of flames flicker like stars. The ballroom is packed with people; all of Toresal's high society seems to be here tonight, and still the enormous hall does not seem full. Servants navigate through the crowds, carrying silver platters loaded with pastries and canapés. Somewhere, a string quartet is playing a lively concerto.

The Earl of Bresa, the Baron of Amhyron, the Duke and Duchess of Inhyron, the Princess and Jacobs the Elder are elsewhere in the crowd.

>talk to baron
Amhyron smiles as you approach. "Good evening, milady," he says, bowing and taking your hand. "I don't believe I've had the pleasure of an introduction. I am Lord Falton, Baron of Amhyron. And you are?"

"Lady Jacqueline," you manage, "of, er... of Toresal."

The Baron's eyebrows lift slightly. "Do tell. How... intriguing. How may I be of service to you this evening, Lady Jacqueline?"

1. "I'm surprised you don't know who I am."
2. "You look like you'd rather be somewhere else."
3. "What do you know about Fossville?"
4. "Did you know my father?"
5. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
6. "What do you think of the Queen?"
7. "What do you think of the Princess?"
8. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
9. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"

>1
"I'm surprised you don't know who I am already," you say with a smile. "It sometimes seems like everyone else here does."

"I didn't recognize you at first, no," says the Baron, "But I can't say I've never heard of you. There were rumors that the old Duke Toresal had a child hidden away somewhere, but I never gave them much thought. As to why you're here, I think I can guess." He smiles. "I suppose you're something of a stick in Fossville's spokes. Aren't you worried he'll come after you?"

1. "He's already tried."
2. "He doesn't know I'm here."

>1
"He's already tried, more than once," you say, proudly. "He hasn't caught me yet."

The Baron's smile broadens. "You certainly seem like a capable young woman," he says. "I suppose it's him I should be worried about."

1. "You look like you'd rather be somewhere else."
2. "Would you support me in the Ascension?"
3. "What do you know about Fossville?"
4. "Did you know my father?"
5. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
6. "What do you think of the Queen?"
7. "What do you think of the Princess?"
8. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
9. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"

>1
"You look like you'd rather be somewhere else," you say. "In fact, if you don't mind my saying so, you're the only person I've met so far who looks as uncomfortable as I feel. I thought a nobleman like yourself would be right at home at a fancy party like this."

The Baron spreads his hands and shrugs. "I'm something of an outsider here, I'm afraid," he says. "Just like you. I'm not very good at idle conversation, and I'm not important enough for anyone to want to chat me up."

1. "I'm surprised you don't know who I am."
2. "Would you support me in the Ascension?"
3. "What do you know about Fossville?"
4. "Did you know my father?"
5. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
6. "What do you think of the Queen?"
7. "What do you think of the Princess?"
8. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
9. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"

>2
Something about the Baron's manner puts you at ease, and you decide to take the direct approach. "Listen," you say, "uh, milord. The only reason I'm here is because I need allies. I don't have very many, and the truth is, I'm not very good at getting more, and I'm getting kind of desperate. So I'm going to come right out and say it. You know who I am... would you be willing to support me in the Ascension?"

The Baron, who has listened to you carefully throughout your whole speech, looks down at the floor and sighs.

"Thank you for your candor, Lady Jacqueline," he says finally, looking you in the eye. "I will try to be equally honest. I'd support just about anyone against Fossville. And I would be overjoyed to support the heir of Duke Toresal most especially. Unfortunately, that may not mean very much. I couldn't garner much more support beyond my own single vote, first of all. I haven't the influence."

The Baron pauses, then looks away. "And secondly, I can't oppose Duke Inhyron's interests without putting myself in jeopardy," he says quietly. "He's the one you need to convince, not me."

1. "Why can't you act against Inhyron?"
2. "What do you know about Fossville?"
3. "Did you know my father?"
4. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
5. "What do you think of the Queen?"
6. "What do you think of the Princess?"
7. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
8. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"

>1
"What makes you so beholden to Inhyron?" you ask. "Can't you speak your own mind?"

"Oh, I speak my mind often," the Baron says quickly. "Everyone pretty much ignores me. Or else they smile condescendingly and say how nice it is that the common folk have someone to represent their interests. And so it goes."

He heaves another sigh. "As for why I am so beholden, my family's land and titles were gifted by Inhyron's ancestor. That means he can remove them whenever he likes."

1. "Would that be so bad?"
2. "If I become Queen, I could help you."

>2
"If I became Queen, I could help you," you point out. "I could grant you Royal lands, or something. You could be independent of Inhyron."

The Baron grins wrily. "That would be wonderful," he says. "But you can't make me independent of the Duke until you're Queen. And to become Queen, you'll need support. And I can't support you until I'm independent of the Duke. And so it goes." He chuckles. "I'm afraid my hands are tied, Lady Jacqueline."

1. "What do you know about Fossville?"
2. "Did you know my father?"
3. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
4. "What do you think of the Queen?"
5. "What do you think of the Princess?"
6. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
7. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"
8. "Good-bye"

>1
"What do you know about Fossville?" you ask.

"Hmm. Fossville, well." The Baron pauses, carefully choosing his words. "I don't like him. He is motivated purely by personal ambition; I don't think he cares a whit about the welfare of his subjects or about actually running the Kingdom, and that will spell disaster for Miradania if he takes the throne. That would be bad enough, but then there are the allegations about how the old Duke Toresal died... I would oppose his candidacy if I could, of course, but even then I'm afraid I wouldn't have enough influence for that to mean very much."

1. "Did you know my father?"
2. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
3. "What do you think of the Queen?"
4. "What do you think of the Princess?"
5. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
6. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"
7. "Good-bye"

>1
"Did you know my father?" you ask.

"Not personally, milady," the Baron says, "but from what I understand he was beloved by his subjects and respected by his fellow noblemen. Many people were sorry when he died."

1. "What do you know about Fossville?"
2. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
3. "What do you think of the Queen?"
4. "What do you think of the Princess?"
5. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
6. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"
7. "Good-bye"

>2
"What do you think of Jacobs the Elder?" you ask.

"Jacobs is an... interesting character," says the Baron. "I'm not quite sure what to make of him, except that he's probably not one to trifle with. And certainly not one to make casual deals with, unless you enjoy losing the shirt off your back without ever realizing that you'd wagered it."

1. "What do you know about Fossville?"
2. "Did you know my father?"
3. "What do you think of the Queen?"
4. "What do you think of the Princess?"
5. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
6. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"
7. "Good-bye"

>3
"What do you think of the Queen?" you ask.

"The Queen is being short-sighted," the Baron says. "She's backing Fossville because she wants to maintain her family's dynasty, but she's not considering what that would mean for the Kingdom as a whole. I have no doubt that she'd as easily switch to some other candidate, but whomever she backs, she'll back for the wrong reasons."

1. "What do you know about Fossville?"
2. "Did you know my father?"
3. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
4. "What do you think of the Princess?"
5. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
6. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"
7. "Good-bye"

"What do you think of the Princess?" you ask. 

The Baron smiles. "Well, the Princess is young," he says. "You can't really blame her for wanting the same thing her mother wants, now can you?"

1. "What do you know about Fossville?"
2. "Did you know my father?"
3. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
4. "What do you think of the Queen?"

6. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"
7. "Good-bye"

>6
"What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?" you ask.

The Baron looks over to where the Earl is telling crude jokes and stuffing his face at the refreshment table. "Oh, Bresa's a good fellow," he says with a smile. "He doesn't care for the social niceties, and that infuriates some peope. But he's smarter than most give him credit for."

1. "What do you know about Fossville?"
2. "Did you know my father?"

"I've enjoyed talking to you, milord Baron," you say, and are surprised to find that you actually mean it. "But if you'll excuse me, I should talk to some of the other guests for a while."

"Of course," the Baron says amiably. "The pleasure has been all mine, Lady Jacqueline."

"What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?" you ask.

The Baron smiles ruefully. "What do I think of him? I think he's an arrogant, self-righteous bigot who's obsessed with his family lineage to an unhealthy degree. And my family owes his family everything. So I keep my mouth shut."

1. "What do you know about Fossville?"

>x queen
Her Royal Majesty is not a tall lady, and most of the time all you can see of her is a flash of golden crown or silver hair glimpsed between the shoulders of her entourage. But every now and then the shoulders part, and you get a good look at her: a pale, angry-looking woman with sharp, shrewish features. Her tiny face is almost lost within the explosion of jewel-encrusted brocade and lace that geysers up from the collar of her gown.

Then, for just a moment, her gaze meets yours. Her stern expression never changes, but her eyes seem to flash a warning. I'm watching you,she seems to say. Do not cross me.

>** It looks like there's a missing space after "watching you,", and I think it should be a comma, not a full stop (period) after "seems to say"
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x princess
Even from across the room, the Princess commands attention; wherever she mingles, conversations stop, and men's eyes follow her. Strangely, she still seems to be avoiding your gaze, although why she would be discomfited by one person when everyone else is openly staring at her is beyond you.

>talk to princess
The Princess pointedly ignores you for a few moments, then, when it's clear that you're not going to go away, she crosses her arms and snaps, "Oh, you must be that ambitious little street urchin Mother told me about. How charming."

1. "I'm not a street urchin."
2. "You should be afraid of me."
3. "So, do you like parties?"

>1
"I am not a street urchin," you say coldly. Sure, technically you were one just yesterday, but you don't have to take that from her. "I am the daughter of a Duke, and I'd ask that you address me with some respect."

The Princess looks at you incredulously and curls her lip. "Are you, like, actually trying to have a conversation with me?" she asks.

1. "Yes, I am."
2. "Did you know that Fossville is a murderer?"
3. "It must be nice, being a Princess."

>1
"Yes, your Highness, I am," you say, determined not to be put off. "It seems to me that getting to know to each other might be to our mutual benefit, even if we do find ourselves at odds."

The Princess looks away, holding one hand delicately against the side of her face as though suffering from a royal headache. "Oh, Goddesses," she moans, "this is so embarrassing."

1. "I know, I know!"
2. "I'm sorry I've made you so uncomfortable."
3. "What can you tell me about the Duke of Inhyron?"
4. "What can you tell me about the Baron of Amhyron?"
5. "What can you tell me about the Earl of Bresa?"

>5
"What can you tell me about-"

"Um, look," interrupts the Princess, "I understand you're having a lot of fun pretending to be someone important? But I'm really not interested in listening to some dressed-up alley rat chatter at me all night. So if you'll excuse me..." And then she shoulders past you and disappears into the crowd.

"Since you're not going to turn me in, why don't you tell me more about Baron Fossville?" you ask.

Jacobs chuckles. "I have to admit, Fossville has guts. I don't think there's a person here that doesn't at least suspect that he poisoned your father. Except for Bresa, perhaps," he adds, rolling his eyes. "No, tonight Fossville is sending a message. He's letting the others know that he knows that they know, and it makes no difference to his plans. He's hoping this show of confidence will sway them over to his side."

He takes a long swig of wine. "On the other hand," he muses, "maybe he planned this whole thing just to trap you."

1. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
2. "Tell me about the Queen."
3. "Tell me about the Princess."
4. "Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron."
5. "Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>1
"Can you tell me anything about my father?" you ask.

Jacobs smirks. "The old Duke spent too much time worrying about his subjects, and not enough time worrying about who else might want to rule them. He left himself open. You'd do well to remember that."

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Tell me about the Queen."
3. "Tell me about the Princess."

5. "Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>2
"Tell me about the Queen," you say.

"Fossville thinks the Queen is here to endorse his courtship of the Princess," Jacobs explains. "But in fact, what she's doing is watching everyone else to see how they react to his schemes. She has no qualms about marrying her daughter to a murderer, but not if there's a chance it might not work out for her politically. Of course, the one thing the Queen hates more than anything else is an unexpected hitch in her plans." He smiles and points his chubby finger. "And that would be you, my dear girl."

6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>3
"Tell me about the Princess," you say.

"The Princess is an opportunist," says Jacobs, "and she sees Fossville as her best chance. There's even been rumors that she's been trying to help the Baron raise money. Anyway, I can't imagine she is very happy to see you here," he adds. "You and she are competing for the same position, now. And you know how jealous girls can get."

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"

7. "Good-bye."

>4
"Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron," you say.

"Duke Inhyron is a stuffed shirt and a hypocrite," Jacobs says with a sour face. "He'd like you to think that he's above all this petty politicking, that he's only here to respect the old Duke's memory, but he's looking for an angle just like everyone else. He has a son of his own, and he'd like nothing better than to marry the little brat into whichever family seizes the throne."

2. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"

6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>5
"Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron," you say.

"The Baron of Amhyron is that rarest of breeds," says Jacobs, "honest, good-hearted, and an effective ruler. Most folks only manage, at most, two out of three." Jacobs thinks for a moment. "The Baron might actually be a good ally for you to cultivate, but you'd need to tread carefully. The Inhyrons gifted his family their lands two generations ago, and they've never let him forget it. He is bound to support their interests whether he likes it or not."

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
3. "Tell me about the Queen."
4. "Tell me about the Princess."
5. "Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>6
"Tell me about the Earl of Bresa," you say.

Jacobs snorts, spraying a mouthful of wine on a passing partygoer. "Bresa is a fat idiot," he says, flatly. "He thinks that by throwing coins about like bird feed, he will create many allies. Instead he creates spongers who know they can get anything from him without providing anything in return. Ignore him; he's useless."

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
3. "Tell me about the Queen."

6. "Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron."
7. "Good-bye."

"Like I said," says Jacobs the Elder, "Baron Amhyron would be a good ally, if only he were free to act on his own."

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
3. "Tell me about the Queen."
4. "Tell me about the Princess."

6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>talk to baron
"Thank you for your advice, Master Jacobs," you say. "I think I'll wander around and play the game with one of the other guests."

Jacobs nods his head as you leave. "Always a pleasure, my dear girl."

"Pardon me," someone says in a low, strangely accented voice, and a hand touches your elbow. You turn to see a tall, dark-skinned man leaning close to you. "Please forgive my forwardness," he murmurs. "I have been waiting for the right moment to speak to you for some time now, but I fear if I wait much longer, I will never get the chance."

He nods towards the ballroom entrance - where several of Fossville's mercenaries are standing!

"Allow me to introduce myself," the stranger says, as though nothing at all were amiss. "I am Prince Gravesal."

>x prince
The Prince cuts such a striking figure, you can't imagine how you failed to notice him until now. Tall and slim, with smooth skin the color of strong tea and long, ink-black hair tied back at the nape of his neck. His clothes, though finely cut, are black as well, devoid of decoration except for a single garnet brooch pinning his cloak at the shoulder. He looks young, perhaps only a few years older than you. And something about his deep, brown eyes makes it difficult for you to concentrate... 

>talk to prince
You are already talking to the Prince of Gravesal.

1. "Who are you?"
2. "You've been watching me?"
3. "I have to get out of here."

>1
Jacobs never mentioned this guy, and you don't remember seeing him in the ballroom until now. "Who are you?" you demand.

"Merely an interested observer," says the Prince with a hint of a smile. "I have been watching you from afar, and watching the reactions of others to you. I am intrigued."

1. "You've been watching me?"
2. "Is this about the Ascension?"
3. "I have to get out of here."

>1
"You've been watching me?" you ask. You want to feel offended, but the way he's looking at you makes that difficult. "Do you mean watching me in a creepy stalker way, or in a secretly working for Fossville way?"

The Prince chuckles. "Neither, actually. Of course I know who you are and why you're here, but that's not what intrigues me. There's something... special about you. I could see it from the moment I laid eyes on you."

1. "I'm special?"
2. "Is this about the Ascension?"
3. "I have to get out of here."

>1
You raise one eyebrow. "So I'm 'special', huh? How so?"

The Prince looks away for a moment. "It is... difficult to explain. People in my family have always been able to see these things. It's like an aura." He looks directly at you again. "You have... a highly visible fate."

1. "What is my fate?"

>undo
Ballroom
[Previous turn undone.]

>2
"And this has nothing to do with the Ascension?" you ask, trying to keep a note of healthy skepticism in your voice. "You don't have some ulterior political motive? You're not looking for some sort of favor down the line?"

The Prince shrugs. "My homeland is far from here,on the outermost edge of the kingdom. I doubt very much the outcome of the Ascension will make much of a difference to me one way or the other." He looks right into your eyes in a way that makes a lump rise up in your throat. "No, mainly I am interested in you."

1. "I'm special?"
2. "I have to get out of here."

>** missing space in "here,on"
I didn't understand that sentence.

>2
"Look," you say, glancing over at the mercenaries working their way through the crowd, "this has been very interesting, but I have to get out of here before those mercenaries spot me."

The Prince seems unconcerned. "It seems they have all the exits blocked, and they're combing the crowd very thoroughly. They will catch you. Why not spend the moments before they do in pleasant conversation, instead of scampering futilely about?"

Even though every instinct you have is urging you to run, you do have to admit there's a certain insane logic to what the Prince is saying.

1. "I'm special?"

>1
You raise one eyebrow. "So I'm 'special', huh? How so?"

The Prince looks away for a moment. "It is... difficult to explain. People in my family have always been able to see these things. It's like an aura." He looks directly at you again. "You have... a highly visible fate."

1. "What is my fate?"

>1
"Okay then, I'll bite," you say. "What do you see in my highly visible fate?"

The Prince looks deeply into your eyes, and goosebumps ripple up your arms as his fingertips brush across your skin. "I see a long journey ahead of you. And many trials."

For just a moment, all you can see are his deep, brown eyes.

"And I see death," he whispers.

The Prince suddenly glances over your shoulder and smiles. "It would seem that your company is desired by someone with greater powers of persuasion than mine," he says. He looks back at you. "Thank you. I hope I will see you again."

He bows deeply; his lips are cool against the back of your hand. And then he is lost in the crowd, as suddenly as he appeared.

A rough hand falls on your shoulder. "Come with us, girl," growls a familiar voice. "The Baron asked us not to drag you out kicking and screaming, so let's not disappoint him, eh?"

Chapter 11 - Baron Fossville 

The mercenaries march you out of the ballroom, through the foyer, and into the inner reaches of the keep. At every doorway you pass a pair of Lord's Guards standing at attention; some of them glare at the ill-kempt and ill-disciplined mercenaries, but no one makes a move to stop them or help you. You are keenly aware of the dagger strapped to your leg under your dress, but there seems to be no opportunity to use it. Not that you'd last very long against a half-dozen armed men anyway.

The last door is not guarded. The mercenaries push you through into a room filled with dim, flickering light.

War Room
A fireplace lights this grim chamber with a hellish, red glow. A huge, round table sits in the center of the room. Hanging opposite the fireplace is a vast map of Miradania, covering nearly the entire wall. An iron-reinforced door leads east.

The mercenaries stand nearby, watching your every move.

Pieter is lying on the floor in front of the fire place, trussed up and gagged.

Someone steps out of the shadows and walks over to stand between you and Pieter. The fire throws his shadow across the length of the room, huge and quivering.

"You know, it's funny," says Baron Fossville, "when I first began planning this venture, I always assumed that you would be the easiest obstacle to take care of."

>x map
(the map)
The map depicts the entire kingdom, from the northern reaches to the Seven Lakes. The cities are marked with semi-precious stones embedded in the map's surface. Aubrimere, the capital, is represented by a ruby the size of your thumb. 

"Poisoning your father, now that was easy." The Baron laughs. "Took a lot of patience. Bit by bit, for weeks and months. So many servants to bribe. But the old fool never suspected a thing. Thought he was only sick until the very end."

He glares at you, eyes glowing in the fire light. "Would that I'd been as patient with you."

>stab baron with dagger
I didn't understand that sentence.

>kill baron
Before you can move, the Baron makes a gesture, and you hear the creak of leather as the mercenaries loosen their blades in their sheaths. "Ah, ah... no funny moves, now," warns the Baron.

Fossville smiles. "But all that's done with now. Once I realized that you were being manipulated into making your own play for the throne-" He stops and glances at you. "You do realize you're being manipulated, don't you? No one really thinks gutter-trash like you has a legitimate claim to the throne, no matter who your father was. Your 'backers' are just using you as a pawn to further their own political ends. Where was I?" He pauses, scratching his chin. "Ah, yes. Once I realized what you were up to, I knew you would show up here. And now this tiresome little game is nearly over, but for a few loose ends."

He holds out his hand. "The letter, please."

>take dagger
You already have that.

"Please let's not draw this out, Jack," sighs the Baron. "Your father's letter, proof of your heritage. I know you have it. Give it to me."

>stab baron
I didn't understand that sentence.

>kill baron
You hear the hiss of steel sliding out of its sheath, and suddenly someone is pushing the pointy end of a sword into your back. "One more false move, and I'll have my men run you through," says the Baron flatly.

The Baron rolls his eyes. "Oh, for the love of - hold her, please?"

The mercenaries seize you and pin your arms behind your back, while the Baron subjects you to a rough and undignified search. "You bring this on yourself," he growls, "always insisting on doing things the hard way... ah-ha!" He finds the letter hidden in a fold of your gown and yanks it free.

He didn't find the dagger, you think. I still have that.

>** Funny the letter should be in a fold of my gown when I put it in the box!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>l
War Room
A fireplace lights this grim chamber with a hellish, red glow. A huge, round table sits in the center of the room. Hanging opposite the fireplace is a vast map of Miradania, covering nearly the entire wall. An iron-reinforced door leads east.

Baron Fossville stands between you and the fireplace, casting his shadow across the entire room.

The mercenaries stand nearby, watching your every move.

Pieter is lying on the floor in front of the fire place, trussed up and gagged.

Fossville holds the letter up to the light, shaking his head slightly as he reads the old words. "Such a nuisance," he mutters. "I can hardly believe it was under my nose all these years, and I never found it. Well, let it be a lesson." And without another word, he walks over to the fireplace and tosses the letter in.

The dry parchment catches instantly, flares up - and it's gone. Your history, your heritage, your one shot at a world beyond the crumbling orphanage and the back alleys of the city - your life - gone in a flash and a swirl of ashes up the chimney. The shock of it hits you like a punch in the gut.

Fossville draws his sword and admires its blade, glowing in the firelight. He smiles as he approaches you, raising his weapon. "And now there's just one last - eh?" He stops, looks to the door.

You can hear shouting outside, the sound of metal ringing on metal.

>kiss baron
What, the man who murdered your father? You'd sooner kiss a pig.

Suddenly the door bursts open - a mercenary staggers backwards into the room, crashes into the table - men rush in, shouting, swords flashing -

Your breath catches in your throat.

It's Bobby!

"Jack! Behind me!" he shouts, slamming his fist into a mercenary's face. He flashes you that devil-may-care grin of his before slashing his way into the room, making a beeline for Baron Fossville.

>attack baron
You try to get close enough to get in a jab with your dagger, but Bobby pushes you back just as the Baron's backswing nearly takes off your hand. "No, Jack!" he yells, "Leave him to me!"

"Give it up, Fossville!" yells Bobby. "You are guilty of murdering Duke Toresal! Ten of my men heard you confess from outside the door. Your bid for the throne is over!"

Fossville brings his own sword up and parries Bobby's cut with a resounding clang. "Goddesses curse it, I thought I was done with you, spy," growls the Baron. "Doesn't anyone stay dead anymore?"

"I'm sure you won't have any trouble," Bobby snaps.

Pieter shouts unintelligibly through his gag.

>remove gag
(first taking the ropes)
Those seem to be a part of Pieter.

Fossville counterattacks, slashing brutally at Bobby's face. Bobby falls back, parrying each blow, until his back hits the edge of the table. The Baron roars and brings his sword up for a killing blow, but Bobby jumps up onto the table, rolls over it, and lands on the other side. He's breathing hard - perhaps the Baron is a better swordsman than Bobby had anticipated.

Pieter struggles desperately against his bonds.

>cut bonds
Working quickly, you saw through the ropes holding Pieter. "Thank you," he gasps, rubbing feeling back into his wrists. Then he grabs up the sword of a fallen mercenary and rushes to Bobby's aid.

Bobby and Pieter fight side by side, attacking one after the other so that the Baron has no chance to counter. He falls back before their onslaught, stumbles... and then he turns and runs out the door, calling for his mercenaries to defend him.

With a shout, Pieter gives chase. Bobby turns to you, grinning. "Wait for me here, Jack," he says. "We'll catch that villain quick enough, and then I'll explain everything." And then with a bound, he is gone.

At that moment, there is a sudden crack and a rumbling, and a cold draft rushes into the room, tugging at the flames in the fireplace and throwing the room into wildly pitching shadow.

Behind you, the map wall has opened to reveal a dark, cavernous passageway, and more men are rushing out - men dressed all in black, with dark hoods and scarves hiding their faces.

"That's her! Get her!" cries a voice. A young woman's voice. A voice you've heard before.

It happens so fast. Hands are on you, lifting you off your feet, wresting the dagger from your grasp, pulling you back into that dark, dark tunnel. The firelight falls away, shrinks down to a flickering, orange rectangle. The rumbling starts again, and the rectangle grows narrower, narrower...

"Don't worry," says the voice. "We're not going to, like, hurt you."

And then everything is black.

The room has become a chaos of shouting voices and ringing steel.

Bobby and Baron Fossville are surrounded by a whirl of flashing steel as they slash and hack at each other. 

Pieter is lying on the floor in front of the fire place, trussed up and gagged.

The two swords clash and clash again. Fossville pushes Bobby back, back across the room, this time backing him towards the roaring fireplace. Bobby is a skilled fighter, but he's losing ground before the Baron's fury. Flames lick the edge of his cloak as he staggers back against the mantelpiece.

You have to do something!

Pieter shouts unintelligibly through his gag.

You try to get close enough to get in a jab with your dagger, but Bobby pushes you back just as the Baron's thrust nearly takes off your ear. "No, Jack!" he yells, "Leave him to me!"

The Baron feints, then strikes Bobby across the face with his pommel. Bobby's sword clatters to the floor and he falls to his knees. Pieter slumps helplessly against his bonds, groaning with dismay.

"It's over, spy," snarls the Baron as he steps forward, sword raised.

It looks as though they worked him over pretty hard before tying him up. His wrists and ankles are all bound together behind his back, the ropes digging cruelly into his skin.
