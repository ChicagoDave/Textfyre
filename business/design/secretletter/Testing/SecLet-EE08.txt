>restore
Ok.

Behind Maiden House
This tiny spur of an alleyway runs between the back of Maiden House and the high stone wall surrounding the park. You can make your way around to the Maiden House Entrance to the northeast.

>restore
Ok.

>look
Underneath The Fountain
The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.

>* I'll try again from here for a bit; Bobby has just gone up and been captured at this point
I didn't understand that sentence.

>i
You are carrying: 
  your old gray cloak (being worn)
  your clothes (being worn)
  your satchel (which is open, containing:)
    a green silk cloak
    an apple
    a cheese
  your hat (being worn)

>eat cheese
(first taking the cheese)
You don't have time for breakfast now!

>** But it's meant to be night time, isn't it? So it would be a strange time for breakfast!
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>n
Ducking your head to avoid the low ceiling, you follow the tunnel for some distance.

Tunnel End
The tunnel ends here at a blank, stone wall.

>** Now, Bobby needed a torch to negotiate this tunnel, but I don't have one now (which could be a good reason for stopping me go this way at this point, since otherwise....)
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x blank stone wall
It's just a blank, featureless, stone wall. You know that one of the bricks must be loose, but they all look the same to you.  

>** Which raises the problem I've mentioned before: if I can't identify the loose brick now, how do I manage to do so later when I come back for the ball?
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>push pricks
You can't see any such thing.

>push bricks
It is fixed in place.

>** Inappropriate response ('bricks' is plural, 'it' is singular, and there should probably be a custom response related to what I'm trying to do here).
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>search bricks
You feel nothing unexpected.

>touch bricks
You feel nothing unexpected.

>pull bricks
It is fixed in place.

>** Again the "It is" is jarring.
I didn't understand that sentence.

>pull brick
It is fixed in place.

>** Okay, so "brick" and "bricks" are synonyms for the same object, but this still seems a bit jarring, since the game should at least recognize what I'm trying to do at this point and give a custom message...
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>** ... explaining why I can't do it.
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x bricks
It's just a blank, featureless, stone wall. You know that one of the bricks must be loose, but they all look the same to you.  

>find loose brick
I didn't understand that sentence.

>pull loose brick
You can't see any such thing.

>** But I know there's one there.
I didn't understand that sentence.

>** As mentioned above, this can all be avoided by refusing to allow Jackie into the tunnel without a light source; then the only way she can go is up into the trap.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>** When she returns for the ball, you could have Pieter produce a torch from somewhere to allow entrance into the tunnel. This would avoid the several glaring inconstancies we otherwise have here.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>back
I didn't understand that sentence.

>go back
If you want to do something to yourself, just refer to 'me' or 'myself'.

>me, go back
But you're already in yourself.

>** Well, that's an odd set of responses!
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>** It may or may not be worthwhile implementing a GO BACK command (to retrace one's steps). 
I didn't understand that sentence.

>* Okay, it looks like there's not much more I can do here, so I better go and let myself get arrested...
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>s
Stealthily, you creep back up the long tunnel.

Underneath The Fountain
The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.

>x steps
The stairs lead back up to the clearing above. 

>x stairs
The stairs lead back up to the clearing above. 

>climb steps
You crawl out of the hole in the base of the statue, into the dirt and leaves littering the bottom of the fountain. Apart from your scrabbling, it's quiet out here. Even the crickets have stopped. Finally, you get to your feet and look around.

Bobby is lying face-down in the grass, just a few yards away. One of the mercenaries from Grubber's Market is kneeling with his knee in the small of Bobby's back, binding his wrists together with twine. Standing around the outside of the fountain are several more mercenaries, looking relaxed and smug. Some of them are chuckling to themselves.

A gaunt man wearing red robes walks up to you. His mouth is half-hidden by long, drooping, black moustaches, but underneath them he is smiling like a snake. "Well now, young...sir? Or is it 'miss'? So much confusion, all to catch one little mouse. You led us a merry chase this morning, little mouse, but I think you will not scurry away from us again."

Leaves crunch behind you. You jump for it, but too slow - rough hands haul you back, and a sack of coarse, black cloth is pulled over your head.

"Good night, little mouse."

Something hard and heavy strikes the back of your head, and the night turns black as pitch.

Chapter 3 - Jail 

Slowly the world comes back to you. You feel something cold and hard against your cheek; something gritty and scratchy under your hand. You hear footsteps on stone, muttering voices that fade in and out. Someone laughs, a raw, cruel sound. A loud squeak, and an echoing, metallic crash. The footsteps fade away.

You open your eyes. It's still dark.

No, it's just dim. Dim light trickles in from somewhere above you.

You sit up, and a tender spot on the back of your head throbs. Red and purple splotches bloom in front of your eyes, then fade away. After a moment or two, your head clears, and you can see where you are.

Holding Cell
A dank, cramped, foul-smelling cell. A pair of ragged burlap blankets and a few lumps of filthy straw litter the floor. The door is to the north. 

A hulking shape squats in the corner, staring at you with bloodshot eyes. 

>x hulking shape
The hulking shape is a huge brute, with a face that looks young, but already grizzled and rough beyond his years. His wide, watery eyes jitter constantly. His lip is curled in a constant half-sneer, as though his confinement in jail is merely a passing diversion for him. His clothes, though stained and rumpled, seem too rich to belong to a common thug. 

>n
(first opening the cell door)
It seems to be locked.

Suddenly you hear a voice whisper your name. "Jack..."

At first you think it's the creepy guy in the corner, but he hasn't moved. You're still staring at him when the whisper comes again, louder this time: "Jack..." It's coming from somewhere outside the cell.

1. "Bobby? Is that you?"

>1
You rush up and press your face against the viewing window, but you can't see anything out there except an empty room. "Bobby?" you call, trying to keep the fear out of your voice. "Bobby, is that you? I'm locked in here, Bobby, help me!"

The voice chuckles, then coughs weakly. "I'm in the cell next to yours, Jack. I'm locked in, too. Sorry."

Your heart sinks a little at that, but at least being trapped in a cell with Bobby nearby is a little bit better than being trapped in a cell with no one around to help you at all... right?

"Jack, listen," Bobby says. His voice is ragged and hoarse; you're worried that the mercenaries might have hurt him badly. "I'm going to get us out of this mess, don't worry. But in case I'm not able to meet up with you after, you need to listen carefully."

1. "What do you mean?"

"Jack, listen to me. Go to Fossville's estate in the city. Use the rooftops. There's an alley behind the shops on Commerce Street where you can climb up."

"You want me to break into Baron Fossville's house?" you whisper back, incredulously. "Bobby, I don't understand-"

"He has secrets," Bobby goes on, "that you need to know. Secrets about your father."

You pause, stunned.

"Look for a letter-" says Bobby, but he is cut off by a door slamming open elsewhere in the room. Guards move past your cell door; one of them slams a wooden cudgel against the bars right in front of your face, and you stagger back.

>listen
You keep your ears pricked.

You hear a metallic rattling, the squeak of hinges. Then several meaty thuds, mixed with grunts and cries of pain. The guards reappear, this time dragging Bobby with them. He looks up as he passes the viewing window, and you get a brief glimpse of his face - bruised, bloody, but still smiling. You'd swear he was trying to wink at you, except that his eye is swollen shut.

"Fossville, Jack!" he yells as they bundle him off. "The rooftops! Look for the letter!"

Somewhere a door slams one final time... and then everything is silent.

>** It does strike me that Bobby is a bit unwise to yell this; it surely invites his guards to report it to Baron Fossville who would then be on his guard to expect the burglary attempt
I didn't understand that sentence.

>hit man
He looks way too scary to mess with.

>jump
You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

Suddenly the shadowy man in the corner puts his huge, thick-fingered hands on his knees and pushes himself up. "Well," he grunts in a thick, rough voice, "now that the guards are busy takin' care of him..." the man stretches, glances at you, and smiles. It is not a friendly smile.

"Hi, kid. Name's Jacobs."

1. "My name's Jack."
2. "Stay away from me!"
3. "Do you know any way to get out of here?"

>** At the very least, it might be good to customize the jump response
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>2
Without meaning to, you find yourself backing into the far corner of the cell. "Stay away from me," you say, trying to sound brave. "I have... I have powerful friends!"

The man named Jacobs glances at you, a flicker of amusement crossing his dull, reddish eyes, but doesn't otherwise respond.

1. "Do you know any way to get out of here?"

>sing
No way. Your singing is enough to make your friend Holstenoffer wince, and he can stomach anything.

>listen
You keep your ears pricked.

>x me
You've definitely been in better shape. And it looks like your disguise is shot, too. Well, it was fun while it lasted.

>1
"Do you, uh...," you clear your throat, "...do you know some way we could get out of this place?"

Jacobs raises an eyebrow. "Well now, little runt. I suppose I do."

The hulking man walks over to the cell door and squints at it for a while, standing with his hands on his hips. "My father'll have me out of here by tomorrow, of course," he mutters, "but I don't like to wait that long." He barely looks at you - in fact, you're not sure that he's talking to you at all. It's more like he's just muttering to himself.

He bends over and digs something out of the side of his boot, then stands up and thrusts his hand through the viewing window. He curses and strains to push his arm through, but the bars are too narrowly spaced - he can't reach out past his elbow. "Damn," he mutters, "didn't expect this..."

>kick jacobs' backside
I only understood you as far as wanting to kick Jacobs.

>kick jacobs
He looks way too scary to mess with.

Jacobs' face reddens with effort. "C'mon... c'mon..." he mutters.

>climb jacobs
He looks way too scary to mess with.

"Aaah! Goddesses curse it!" Jacobs jerks his hand back, rubbing his wrist.

"Well, you gonna help me, runt, or not?" he asks, and holds out a short, stiff piece of wire, pinched between his thumb and forefinger.

1. "What is that thing?"
2. "I'd rather not."
3. "Okay."

>2
Picking locks has never been your strong suit, and the idea of this brute breathing over your shoulder while you try it gives you stomach-flips. "Uh-uh," you say, holding up your hands and backing away. "I'd rather not, if it's all the same."

"Oh, for the love of - fine!" he yells. He throws the lockpick to the floor and stomps back to his corner. "I guess I'll just wait for my father, then. A hundred cells in this twice-cursed jail, and I get stuck in the one with a dim-witted, muling runt and a tiny window..."

>x window
The viewing window is just a tiny square, no more than two handspans to a side, fitted with tough, closely spaced iron bars. 

>pull bars
Nothing obvious happens.

>** Custom response needed?
I didn't understand that sentence.

>break window
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>** Again, it might be nice to have a custom response
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>jump over jacobs
If you want to jump, just type JUMP.

>climb through window
I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

>** Well, were it possible, it would facilitate my escape, which would be achieving quite a bit: a custom refusal is required, I think.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>look through window
You peer through the closely spaced bars. You can see the jailhouse main room on the other side.

>x jailhouse
You see nothing of interest in that direction.

>l
Holding Cell
A dank, cramped, foul-smelling cell. A pair of ragged burlap blankets and a few lumps of filthy straw litter the floor. The door is to the north. 

Jacobs is sulking in the corner. 

You can also see a lockpick here.

>search straw
The straw is disgusting; you'd rather not even get near it.

>eat straw
(first taking the straw)
The straw is disgusting; you'd rather not even get near it.

>smell straw
You can smell it just fine from where you're standing.

>** That response seems a bit inconsequential.
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x blankets
The blankets are threadbare, filled with holes, and stained with Goddesses-know-what. You can hardly believe that anyone would actually cover themselves with something like this. 

>take them
You'd just as soon leave the blankets where they are.

>look under blankets
You'd just as soon leave the blankets where they are.

>x door
The cell door is made of stout wood reinforced with bands of iron. A tiny viewing window in the upper half of the door allows guards to look in and prisoners to look out. The cell door is closed. 

>x viewing window
The viewing window is just a tiny square, no more than two handspans to a side, fitted with tough, closely spaced iron bars. 

>x iron bars
The viewing window is just a tiny square, no more than two handspans to a side, fitted with tough, closely spaced iron bars. 

>look through viewing window
You peer through the closely spaced bars. You can see the jailhouse main room on the other side.

>x pick
It's a short bit of stiff wire, like the ones you've sometimes seen Bobby carrying around. 

>take it
"That's the spirit, runt!" Jacobs says. Suddenly he comes over and puts his huge hands around your waist, hoisting you up as though you weighed no more than a sack of feathers. He feels strong enough to snap you in half.

"You ever pick a lock before, runt?"

1. "Yes."
2. "No."

>2
"No," you lie.

"Well, doesn't matter," Jacobs mutters, pushing you up against the viewing window. "These jail locks aren't complicated. Just reach down there and jiggle around a bit."

>reach down
You don't need to "reach" anything in this game. If you want to see what's inside something, just LOOK IN it. 

>** Except Jacobs has just told me to "just reach down"
I didn't understand that sentence.

>look in lock
You can't, not while Jacobs has you firmly in his grip.

>jiggle pick
I didn't understand that sentence.

>** Of course I know what to do, but I wonder if this could seem a bit "guess the verb" to a novice player.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x lock
The cell door is made of stout wood reinforced with bands of iron. A tiny viewing window in the upper half of the door allows guards to look in and prisoners to look out. The cell door is closed. 

>pick lock
You slip your arm through the bars and reach down for the lock. It's a stretch - Jacobs has to lift you higher and press your shoulder painfully against the bars - but soon you feel the metal of the lockplate, and your fingers find the tiny, sharp-edged hole in the middle.

You jam the end of the lockpick in and start wiggling it around. Almost immediately, you realize that this is not going to work. The angle is too awkward, and you can't see what you're doing, and you can't feel the tumblers the way Bobby showed you when you practiced on the front door of Maiden House...

Then you feel the wire bump against something inside the lock. You manage to lever the end of the wire under something and push... you feel it start to give... you push a little harder, and it starts to pivot... you push harder, and it starts to slip off the end of your pick...

And then there is a snap, and the pick jumps out of your fingers and tumbles to the ground outside the cell door.

Jacobs puts you down. He puts his hand on the door... and pushes it open.

"Well," he says, looking you over with a sly expression, "you are a valuable runt, after all."

>undo
Holding Cell
[Previous turn undone.]

>put arm through bars
If you want to try to unlock the door, just type UNLOCK DOOR. 

>** Maybe the other phrasings could be dealt with in this way?
I didn't understand that sentence.

>unlock door
(with the lockpick)
You slip your arm through the bars and reach down for the lock. It's a stretch - Jacobs has to lift you higher and press your shoulder painfully against the bars - but soon you feel the metal of the lockplate, and your fingers find the tiny, sharp-edged hole in the middle.

Jacobs puts you down. He puts his hand on the door... and pushes it open.

"Well," he says, looking you over with a sly expression, "you are a valuable runt, after all."

>talk to jacbos
You can't see any such thing.

>talk to jacobs
He doesn't answer you at all; he just keeps staring with those creepy, bloodshot eyes.

Jacobs goes north.

>n

Jailhouse
The jailhouse is hardly more comfortable than the cells themselves, just a crude, small room of unfinished stone, with a wooden bench and table for the guards. Cells are south, west, and north. A foul smell comes from a tiny alcove to the southwest, and a passageway to the east leads out.

Jacobs stands staring at you with bloodshot eyes. 

You can also see a lockpick here.

Jacobs turns to you. "I heard what your friend in the other cell said, before they dragged him out," he says. "Sounds like Fossville's taken quite an interest in you."

1. "Yes, he has."
2. "I don't know what you're talking about."

>2
Something tells you not to trust this man. "I don't know what you're talking about," you say, trying to sound tough and sullen. "I don't know what he was talking about, either. Why would Fossville be interested in me?"

Jacobs gives you a shrewd look. You're not sure if he believes you or not.

The big man seems to consider something. "You can come with me if you want," he says. "I'll take you somewhere safe."

A shaky, wheedling voice from the north cell calls out: "Don't you listen to him, girl! That's Jacobs the Elder's son; he'd as soon sell you to slavers as help you."

"Shut up, you!" yells Jacobs, pounding on the cell door in a sudden rage.

1. "Sure, let's go."
2. "No, thanks."

>2
"No offense," you say, "but I'll find my own way out, thanks."

"Fine, then," Jacobs snarls, "good luck getting past the guards, runt." He turns on his heel and stalks out, leaving you alone with the other prisoners.

"Do us a kindness, girl, and free us as well," whines the man in the north cell. "We ain't done nothin' terrible, and we can show you a way out, too, one that doesn't include leaving you dead in an alley for your shoes."

1. "Hang on for a minute."
2. "All right, I'll let you out."
3. "Who are you?"

>2
"All right, hold your horses," you say. "I'll let you out."

Picking a lock is much easier when you're standing on the ground and can see what you're doing. Twenty seconds, and you have the cell door open.

"Oh, thank you, miss, thank you kindly. Goddesses' blessings upon you. Allow me to make introductions," the man wheezes. "I am called Olmer, and this is my associate, Darrens." The skinny man standing behind him smiles and nods enthusiastically.

"Now," says Olmer, "if you will follow us, we will make our escape."

Olmer and Darrens go southwest.

>talk to olmer
You can't see any such thing.

>follow olmer
You don't see Olmer here.

>** I may have noted this in the previous transcript; but FOLLOW BOBBY worked in similar circumstances, so consistency suggests that FOLLOW OLMER should work here.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>sw

Drain Room
This tiny alcove reeks worse than the privy back at Maiden House, and that's saying something. The main room is back to the northeast.

Set into the stone floor is a metal grate.

You can also see Olmer and Darrens here.

"The guards use this place to relieve themselves," Olmer explains, "and sometimes for beatin' prisoners when they don't feel like moppin' the cells after. My back's not much for physical labor, but a spry one like yourself should have little trouble." He motions for you to lift up the grate.

>lift up the grate
It's a strain, but you're just barely able to lift the heavy grate and drop it to the side with a dull clang. Olmer smiles and gestures towards the foul-smelling hole. "After you," he wheezes.

>smell
The smell in here is overpoweringly foul.

>x hole
The hole is too dark and too deep for you to see the bottom, although you think you can hear the sound of running water coming from far below. 

>listen
You can faintly hear the sound of running water coming from below.

>go through hole
Well, it can't be that much worse than rotting in prison, you think. You sit down and dangle your feet over the edge of the hole. You can hear the sound of running water, and smell the sharp stink of sewage. You offer a quick prayer to Brigid - Please give me a chance to clean up before seeing Bobby again - take a deep breath, and drop down into darkness.
Chapter 4 - Sewer 

Sewer
The tunnels down here are made of ancient, unmortared brick, slimy with centuries of filth and mold. Dim light trickles down through narrow vents in the ceiling. Side tunnels split off in numerous directions, twisting away into darkness.

Painted on the walls are a number of odd symbols.

Olmer drops down into the muck next to you, followed by Darrens. "Now then, miss, cast your eye at these glyphs here," whispers Olmer. His voice echoes off into the blackness as he brushes the rough stone with his fingertips. "These are marked down by such poor blokes as have to take refuge down here on a more regular basis. They tells you where the tunnels lead, if you but know their language." Darrens nods in solemn agreement.

"To get back to your neighborhood, you'll want to follow the blue, see?" Olmer points off down the south tunnel. "Darrens and I, we must be off elsewhere, so we'll take our leave of you now. But follow the blue and you can't go wrong."

"It was very kind of you to set us free, young lady." He shakes your hand. (His hands are slimy with filth, but then so are yours.) "We've only our meagre gratitude with which to repay you, but we won't forget your generosity." Darrens nods vigorously and shakes as well.

And then the two of them slosh off, leaving you alone.

>** The PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE seemed to be missing before the new chapter heading
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x symbols
The symbols are a number of crude shapes, no bigger than your hand. Each one is painted on the wall next to one of the side tunnels, as if to mark the way. You can make out a green circle next to the north tunnel, a yellow square next to the east tunnel, a blue crescent next to the south tunnel and a red diamond next to the west tunnel.

A ladder is bolted to the wall here.

>up
You eagerly pull yourself up the rungs and shove open the hatch. Daylight! You've never been so glad to see it. 

From the look of the sky, it's early morning. You're standing in an empty alleyway, pretty close to Maiden House if you have your landmarks right. After a couple of turns, you figure out where you are, and soon find yourself back in familiar environs.
Chapter 5 - Black Gate Estate 

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs east to west, between Grubber's Market and Lord's Market. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east. 

>** Again the PRESS ANY KEY break before the chapter heading is missing
I didn't understand that sentence.

>* Obviously, at this point I'm meant to go straight for the butcher's shop and onto the roof, so what happens if I try to something different?
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>w
It might be a good idea to avoid Grubber's Market for a while. Once they figure out you escaped from your cell, they'll be searching for you everywhere; they looked in Grubber's once, they'll look there again.

>e

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

>s
No, too risky. Better visit the park another day.

>n
(first opening the front gates)
The front gates are securely locked.

>pick lock
You can't see any such thing.

>** Since the gates are securely locked, I can presumably see the lock
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>i
You are carrying: 
  a lockpick
  your clothes (being worn)

>** And I might at least want to try my lockpick on it
I didn't understand that sentence.

>unlock gates with lockpick
The lock on these gates is too sturdy for you to pick with the little lockpick.

>** Ah, good! If PICK LOCK gave the same response, that would be excellent.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>climb gates
The fence is too high to climb, and topped with sharp iron spikes to boot. 

>e

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south.

The inside of this store is tasteful but austerely decorated, perhaps to better draw the eye towards the glass display case in the center of the room and the king's ransom in jewelry contained therein. You can leave to the west.

Pieter stands discreetly near the back of the room.

Dame Sandler looks up as you burst into her shop, and her face only betrays a hint of surprise before settling into a carefully expressionless pose. "Why Jack," she says, "you look an absolute fright. Whatever is the matter?"

1. "No, nothing's wrong."
2. "Have you seen Bobby?"

>2
"Dame Sandler," you plead, "have you seen Bobby or heard anything about where he might be?"

She glances quickly at Pieter, who frowns. Then she turns back to you. "I only know that he was taken up by Fossville's men," she says, calmly. "But I imagine you already know that. I... don't know what they plan to do with him. I'm sorry."

Seeing the look of desperation on your face, Dame Sandler continues, "Did Bobby give you any... instructions... before you were separated?

1. "No."
2. "He told me to break into Baron Fossville's house and steal a letter."

>* Ah, this is interesting; it looks like a possible branch I hadn't seen yet.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>1
Something about her question triggers your suspicions, and you pause. "No," you say, forcing your voice to sound level and calm. "He didn't give me any instructions."

Dame Sandler nods slowly. "Well then, Squire Jack, you appear to be out of options. The wisest course of action probably would be to find a place to hide... and stay there."

She stands up and moves over to the door. "And now, my dear boy, I'm afraid I must ask you to leave. It is not safe for you here, and it is not safe for me to have you here. Please forgive me for being so abrupt; I hope that soon I will be able to explain more to you. But for now, good-bye and good luck. Take care, Jack."

And she gently pushes you out the door, and locks it behind you.

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south.

"Yes," you say nervously, unsure of whether you should be trusting her with this information or not. "He told me there's an alley behind the shops on Commerce Street where I can climb up to the rooftops; then I'm to break into Baron Fossville's house, and steal a... a letter."

Dame Sandler's eyebrows arch and she inclines her head slightly. "A letter," she murmurs. "How interesting. Well then, Squire Jack, I suppose you had better get to it. The shops on Commerce Street most likely will have back doors leading to the alley; one of them is sure to grant you access if you ask."

She stands up and moves over to the door. "And now, my dear boy, I'm afraid I must ask you to leave. It is not safe for you here, and it is not safe for me to have you here. Please forgive me for being so abrupt; I hope that soon I will be able to explain more to you. But for now, good-bye and good luck. Take care, Jack."

Royal Tunic
The walls are hung with tasteful curtains, and a deep, soft carpet covers the floor. Several clothier's dummies stand about the room, displaying gorgeous formal court apparel for both men and women. The street lies west.

The clothier stands nearby, eyeing you with some distaste.

>talk to clothier
The clothier sniffs and pretends not to hear you.

>take a dress
The clothier is not likely to sell anything to a dirty urchin such as yourself. Besides, you're only interested in the dresses, and it would raise awkward questions if you asked him to sell you one.

>x dummies
Armless, headless torsos carved from wood, stuck atop iron tripods, and dressed in fancy clothes. They're actually a bit ghoulish, now that you really look at them. 

>x fancy clothes
The clothes here are lovely - rich velvets and flowing silks, dyed with brilliant colors and embroidered with lace and gems. These are the sorts of costumes that you imagine while lying on your straw mattress back at Maiden House, dreaming about dazzling the Prince at the Royal Ball. Stupid fantasies, you know, but oh - if you could only wear something as beautiful as these, just for one evening...

Suddenly, you remember that you're supposed to be looking at the men's clothing. You glance nervously at the shopkeeper, but he doesn't seem to find your intense interest in ladies' formal wear strange in the slightest. 

>out
"Come back soon, sweetie," calls the clothier as you leave.

Chorus Brothers
The inside of this shop is dark - dark wood paneling on the walls; deep, wine-dark carpeting on the floor; even a pair of huge, leather armchairs over in one corner. The back half of the room is hidden behind a wall of reinforced wood, with a wide window cut through the center.

The Chorus Brothers hover behind their window, staring at you.

>x brothers
It's in some ways fortunate that you're not on a first-name basis with these fellows, because you'd never be able to tell them apart. Their faces are utterly identical, from the tops of their bald, cadaverous heads down to the black, dusty collars of their coats.

Both brothers raise their eyebrows (one left, the other right) simultaneously. After a moment, one of them says, "Forgive us. We are..."

The window forms a sort of counter, with an ornately scrolled, brass grating that opens to the inside, allowing customers to speak with the proprietors on the other side.

It's probably best to stay away from Maiden House at the moment. The Widows will be on the lookout for you, and it's not like they'd do anything bad to you or anything, but if they catch you they won't let you out of the orphanage until you're an old crone. And you have important work to do. First, Fossville's house; then you can go back to Maiden House.

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

>x black gate
Black Gate Estate is the home of Baron Fossville, the current Lord of Toresal since the old Duke's death (though he has yet to be fully confirmed). It is a somber building of dark flagstone and slate, although you've heard the Baron keeps a beautiful rooftop garden. 

>enter black gate
The servants would never let someone like you enter unless you had urgent business with the Baron, which they'd never believe you had anyway.

>w

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs east to west, between Grubber's Market and Lord's Market. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east. 

>* I'll try the other two shops before the butcher's
I didn't understand that sentence.

>enter bakery

Bakery
The air is heavy with the warm and slightly damp smell of freshly baked bread, and the counters are piled high with golden loaves, baguettes, and rolls. You can leave the bakery to the south.

A man dressed in flour-dusted baker's whites stands behind the counter, busily rolling out dough.

Germaise the baker looks up at you and scowls. You're utterly filthy, of course, and he doesn't appear to be too happy about you fouling up his shop.

1. "Have you seen Bobby?"
2. "Is there a back door here?"

>1
"Have you seen Bobby this morning?" you ask, trying to keep the edge of fear out of your voice.

"No," Germaise sniffs. "And I'd like to keep it that way."

1. "Is there a back door here?"

>1
"Is there a back door in your shop?" you ask.

Germaise looks at you incredulously. "No, there isn't, and no, you can't use it. And why would I tell you anyway, eh? So you can tell your cretin friend Bobby so he can break in and steal all my beautiful pastries?" He shakes his head, dislodging fine drifts of flour from his hair. "Go away, Jack. I am very, very busy."

>talk to germaise
It doesn't seem as though Germaise is going to be very helpful. You'd have better luck talking to someone else.

Germaise cuts the dough into strips, twists the strips into a complicated shape, and slides the whole thing into the glowing mouth of the brick oven behind him. Then he slaps another mound of dough onto the counter and starts the process all over again.

>x dough
"Eh, keep away from the pastry dough, Jack," Germaise warns you. "This is delicate business."

>enter armoury

Armory
The tangy smell of oiled steel is nearly overpowering in this small, windowless shop. All of the really interesting weapons - axes, flails, spiked gauntlets and the like - are high up on racks on the back wall, well behind the high counter. However, there is a display of assorted knives and daggers sitting out where you can get a close look at them.

Olgan Minor, the proprietor, leans against the counter, watching you intently.

>talk to minor
"Um, mind if I ask you something?" you stammer.

The man's lip twitches slightly, but he says nothing. You decide (foolishly, perhaps) to interpret this as a "yes".

1. "Tell me about your weapons."
2. "What do you know about the mercenaries in Grubber's Market?"
3. "Have you seen Bobby lately?"
4. "What do you think about Baron Fossville?"
5. "Is there a back door here?"
6. "Never mind."

"I'm through listening to your chatter, little boy," Olgan growls. "Now get out of my store before I decide to test my wares on your soft, pink hide." He advances on you menacingly, and you find yourself backpedaling towards the door.

Butcher's Shop
Chains of linked sausages and thick, red cuts of meat dangle from hooks in the ceiling, and trays of less identifiable bits sit out on the counters. It's better than some butcheries you've seen, but it's still not your favorite place in the city. You can leave to the south.

Old Man Holstenoffer is leaning over his huge, bloodstained butcher block behind the counter, hacking up some carcass.

Holstenoffer looks up as you enter his shop, and his eyes widen. "Goddesses, Jack," he says, "you look like you've had the worse of it. Widow Fiona was just in this morning, lookin' for yeh. Is everything all right?"

1. "Have you seen Bobby?"
2. "Is there a back door here?"

>2
"Listen, is there a back door in your shop?" you ask, craning to see around Holstenoffer's huge frame.

"Yeah..." he says slowly, giving you an odd look. "Don't lead to nothin' but a closed-off alley, though. What do yeh want back there for?"

1. "Just let me back there."
2. "It's to help Bobby."

1. "No, I'm just looking for him."
2. "Yes, he's been captured by Fossville's men."

>1
You want to tell Holstenoffer, but the words catch in your throat. Who can you trust, really? "Um, no, no trouble," you say. "I'm just looking for him, is all."

Holstenoffer sets his mouth in a grim line. It's clear he doesn't believe you, but Holstenoffer's never been one to pry. "All right, then," he says.

1. "Is there a back door here?"

"It was Fossville!" you blurt out before you can stop to think whether you should. "His mercenaries captured Bobby and me in the woods north of town... I got away, but Bobby's still in jail."

Holstenoffer's jaw clenches and he shakes his head. "Aw, stupid, brave lad. And that rotten Fossville. I'm so sorry, Jack. If I can do anything for yeh, just tell me, all right?"

1. "Is there a back door here?"

2. "It's to help Bobby."

"Please, Holstenoffer," you say, "just let me back there."

He looks you square in the eye. "Now look, Jack," he says, pointing his cleaver at you, "Yer a good lad and I like yeh, but I can't go lettin' urchins run through my shop whenever they've got a hankerin', yeh know? If you want me to help yeh, yer gonna have to tell me what's going on.

1. "It's to help Bobby."

>1
You take a deep breath. "I need to get up onto the rooftops, so I can get to... a place." You're not sure if Holstenoffer would actually disapprove of breaking into Fossville's house, in principle, but he probably wouldn't approve of you doing it yourself. "Please, Holstenoffer. I need to get up there to help Bobby."

Holstenoffer looks at you for a few moments, then nods his head. "All right then. Come around the counter here."

You follow the burly butcher to the back of his shop, where he unlocks and opens a small metal door. "Be safe now, Jack," he says, laying a thick hand on your shoulder. "Do what yeh have to do."

A twinge of guilt nags at you. Technically, you don't have any idea whether this letter will help Bobby or not, although you certainly hope it does. But what else can you do? "Thanks," you whisper, and step through the door.

Closed Alleyway
The walls of the alley are so close together you can barely squeeze your shoulders through; the rough brick and mortar catches at your clothes. The ends of the alley are walled off. There's no way out except back through the little door you came in.

A rusted rain gutter clings to the wall.

>x gutter

>climb wall

>up
You give the pipe a few experimental tugs, then take a deep breath and start shimmying up. The rain gutter squeaks and groans in protest. Your fingers cramp and your toes scrabble to find purchase on the rough bricks. Finally, three stories up, you grab the edge of the rooftop and haul yourself over.

Rooftop
The rooftops are like a miniature mountain range up here, with peaks and valleys sloping away into the distance. Chimneys and stovepipes stand sentry like the keeps and towers of castles. Bobby has exclaimed the virtues of rooftop travel before, and finally you see what he was going on about. It feels like you could explore forever up here.

>n
You need to focus on getting to Fossville's mansion, and if memory serves, that's east of here.

>down
It took quite an effort to get up here. You're not climbing back down until you find what Bobby told you to find... the letter in Fossville's mansion.

>e

Rooftop Edge
The rooftop landscape ends here at a wide street dividing Commerce Street from the more affluent residential district that borders it. Far, far below, you can see all the little people going about their business.

To the east, across the gap, you spy a balcony.

>e
You peer across the gap at the balcony, judging the distance. About ten feet. Maybe a little bit more than ten feet. And it's slightly below you, which is a plus.

Still, it's a really far jump.

This is where Bobby told you to go. A letter... secrets about your father, he said. The thought of facing Bobby when he gets out, after they beat him up so bad, and telling him you were too scared to do what he asked you to do...

You take a few steps back, run... and jump.

The railing slams into your chest, knocking the breath out of you. Your feet pedal madly in empty air. You wrap your arms around the railing, trying to grab on, but you're slipping...

Then your foot finds the edge of the balcony, and you push yourself up and over.

Balcony
You're standing on a balcony, complete with ornate railing, that runs along the roof's western edge. To the northeast is a garden; to the southeast, a patio.

>ne

Rooftop Garden
The garden is an impressive piece of greenery in a city otherwise dominated by stone. Most of the flowers are not in bloom this late in the season, but there are autumn roses, and some nice hanging lilies climbing up a lattice. The patio is south, and the balcony lies to the southwest. Nearby, a flight of steps leads down into the lower floors of the house.

>x lattice

>d
Holding your breath, you tiptoe quietly down the stairs. A prickle runs up your spine; you are now an intruder. If the Baron catches you here, he'll have you tossed back into a jail cell - and that's the best case scenario. If what Bobby told you is true, and Fossville knows secrets about you that he's trying to hide, it's more likely he'll just slit your throat.

Have to move quickly, then - search the house, find this letter, and get out.

The sounds of sudden, frantic activity drift up the stairs: footsteps, chairs scraping on wooden floors, glasses and dishes clinking.

On a sudden impulse, you pick a random book from the shelf of older books. A folded sheet of parchment slips out from the pages and see-saws to the floor.

>x folded sheet of parchment
You pick up the letter. The parchment is thin and the ink faded, but the writing is still quite legible, a strong, graceful script that flows down the page.

Your Royal Highness, it begins,

It is with a sad but hopeful heart that I write to you, for I must reveal deeds that I am not proud of, and yet perhaps I may thereby put an end to an injustice that has gone on far too long.

My lawful marriage was determined by political expediency rather than by the urgings of my own heart, as you well know. My wife was ever a dutiful companion, but never truly happy. I do not blame her. For my part, I did my best to ensure that she lived a lifestyle fitting for a Duchess, and that she wanted for nothing save my love.

Were this the full extent of my shame, I would have no need to write to you, for a loveless marriage is hardly a rare thing in our kingdom. However, it is to confess yet a further disgrace that I must pen this letter. I was not merely cool in my affections, but an unfaithful husband as well. I took a mistress, a woman on whom I bestowed all the tenderness I was unable to give my wife. And with this mistress, I had a child.

I kept the child's existence a secret, as much to spare my wife the ignominy as to avoid the political complications that would otherwise have ensued. From my private finances I established an orphanage here in the city, and paid a tutor from the Royal College to pose as one of the headmistresses, to raise and educate the child properly. In secret I have sponsored this child for ten years.

I feel it is past time for this secrecy to end. I have grown ill with a mysterious sickness these past months, and I fear that my life will soon come to a close. My wife was never able to provide me with a lawful heir, and yet I would not see my family name extinguished merely because I had not the courage to face up to my failings as a husband.

Therefore it is my wish that the crown recognize this child, who bears no fault for the circumstances of her birth, as my sole and lawful beneficiary, to inherit my title and estate in full upon my death, or upon her sixteenth birthday should I die before she reaches the age of majority. I hereby, by my will and by royal law, and in full possession of my faculties, declare my heir:

           Jacqueline Toresal

Signed and witnessed therewith,

Lord William, Duke of Toresal

 

Your hand is trembling as you refold the letter. You tell yourself that it's a coincidence, just someone who happens to have the same first name as you - but in your heart you know it must be true.

And yet... it poses so many more questions than it answers. The letter is addressed to the queen, and dated three years ago, just a few months before the Duke's death. Why was it never posted? And what is it doing in Baron Fossville's library?

A noise from the bedroom startles you out of your puzzling. Now that you have what you came for, you need to get out of here - fast.

You leave the library in a rush - and run smack into someone coming the other way.

It's all you can do to bite back a scream. You try to duck around the person and run, but he grabs your arm and pulls you back. "Little thief!" a voice hisses, "What are you doing here? What do you have?"

He turns you around to face him. He's an older man, wearing a servant's uniform - Fossville's butler.

Master Bedroom
The bedroom, as you might have expected, is dominated by an enormous bed and not much else. Sliding doors lead north, back to the parlor, and another doorway leads south.

A butler is standing here, eyeing you suspiciously.

>*** Right - it's the GO NORTH command that makes the butler appear, but GO THROUGH DOORWAY circumvents it, which is clearly a bug.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x butler
The butler is tall and somewhat gaunt, with a heavy brow and a sour, twisted cast to his mouth. He looks like he doesn't like kids very much, especially when they're somewhere they shouldn't be. 

The butler drags you into the stairwell, then stops, his thin, bald head cocked, listening. From downstairs you hear more voices.

"...difficult is it to keep one half-witted street urchin locked in a cage for a single night?" That's the Baron again, you realize. "Because it is evidently far more difficult than I imagined. Perhaps I am not paying you enough for your heroic efforts so far?"

You hear a low, mumbled response.

"No, I daresay you don't," snaps the Baron, his voice acid with sarcasm. "I cannot express how galling it is that I still require your services; were it otherwise, I would sooner turn you all over to the Lord's Guards and let them deal with you like the useless curs you are."

The butler glances at you, one bushy eyebrow raised. You're beginning to suspect that Baron Fossville is not particularly well liked by his servants.

>talk to butler
"Hush," the butler snaps, cutting you off. "I've no great desire to see the master inflict his cruelties upon a child, but I'll not lose my position over it. Keep your lips sealed if you want to leave this place unscathed."

"Gather your men at Lord's Market," says Fossville. "We'll deal with the spy first. Once that business is finished, we pay a visit to the Widows. Though I suppose I should warn you - you may encounter several unarmed, elderly women there. Let us hope they pose no greater challenge to your mercenaries than a fourteen-year-old girl."

The second voice mumbles another response.

"See that you do. I will be there shortly."

You hear footsteps, and then a heavy door slamming.

The butler holds his hand up, palm out. Wait.

>sing
No way. Your singing is enough to make your friend Holstenoffer wince, and he can stomach anything.

Several agonizing minutes later, you hear the door slam a second time. The butler waits a few minutes more, then drags you downstairs. He takes you through the kitchens to a side door, and shoves you unceremoniously out onto the street.

"Go now, and don't come back," he says. "Next time, it won't be me that catches you. And if it is me, it'll go that much worse for you. A bit of advice, girl," he adds, just before turning away. "Keep yourself out of the Baron's way. He's not one to let a trifling of blood get in between him and his ambitions."

He slams the door.
Chapter 6 - Gallows 

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

There seems to be some sort of spectacle going on in Lord's Market; pedestrians are crowding the streets, pressing east.

>** Once again there was no PRESS ANY KEY break before the new chapter heading
I didn't understand that sentence.

>e

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is packed with people from every part of the city, all of them pressing in, blocking the streets. You've never seen it this crowded before. 

There is some sort of wooden structure erected in the center of the square.

>stand on structure
There are too many people in your way, and you can't push through.

>x people
The crowd is made up of people from every part of the city. Men and women, aristocrats and servants, merchants and beggars, all rubbing shoulders and craning to see. 

A man steps up onto the wooden platform. By squeezing between two spectators and craning your neck, you can just make out that it is Baron Fossville addressing the crowd.

"Citizens of Toresal," he shouts, "as Lord of this City, it is my duty to administer justice within its gates, and punish those who transgress against the Queen's Law. More often than not, this duty is a heavy burden. Though I may wish to be lenient, consideration for the sanctity of the law and the safety of the Queen's subjects must always outweigh my softer instincts. Today, this burden weighs particularly upon me, for today I must administer the most stringent punishment allowed by the law."

Soldiers prod a second man up onto the platform. The black bag covers his face, but you recognize him by the clothes he's wearing - it's Bobby!

>talk to people
You can only do that to something animate.

>** And there was I thinking people WERE animate!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>kill fossville
You can't reach him. There are too many people in the way.

"This man before you stands accused of plotting high treason against the city of Toresal," shouts the Baron. "The evidence against him has been weighed, and he has been found guilty by the Honorable Magistrate Hester Rudup."

Fossville gestures to a third man standing on his other side, a gaunt man wearing crimson robes - the man who captured you last night at the fountain.

>x bobby
He's still wearing the mud- and blood-stained clothes he wore last night, when you snuck into Lord's Keep. His hands are bound behind his back, and a black cloth bag is pulled down over his head. 

"Despite the grief it causes me, the penalty for this most heinous crime is clear." Fossville pauses; the crowd is hanging on his every word. "By the power invested in me and in accordance with the Queen's Law... I hereby sentence this man to hang by the neck until dead."

The Baron turns to one of his soldiers at the platform's base and nods his head.

Later, you cannot remember whether you really heard the clunk of the trapdoor falling open, the rope snapping taut, or whether you only imagined it. You remember screaming, clawing at the spectators in front of you, and being pushed back by rough, angry hands. You stumbled and fell onto the cobblestones. You never saw his body drop.

Everything goes black.

Chapter 7 - Mercenaries Again 

You are lying on something soft. Blankets, a thin mattress - you're back in Maiden House, lying in your own bunk. Fiona is sitting on the edge of the bed, watching you with a tender expression. Her eyes are red and raw, though, like she's been crying. For a moment, you feel strange, disconnected. You wonder what's wrong.

And then it comes back to you. It's Bobby. Bobby is dead.

You feel like there's something important you should say to Fiona, but you can't think of what it is.

1. "How did I get here?"
2. "I'm sorry I snuck out."
3. "Bobby is dead. They killed Bobby."

>2
"I... I... um..." You cough. There's something caught in your throat. There's something burning behind your eyes, making everything blurry... "I'm sorry I..."

"Shh," whispers Fiona. She lays her hand gently on the side of your face. "Shh. It's all right."

1. "How did I get here?"
2. "Bobby is dead. They killed Bobby."

>1
"How... how did I get here?" you ask. Your throat is dry; your voice barely a croak.

Fiona strokes your forehead. Her fingertips are cool on your skin. "Shannon found you," she whispers, "after the crowd dispersed. She brought you back here."

1. "Bobby is dead. They killed Bobby."

>1
"Bobby..." you manage to say, but then your throat closes up around the words, and it hurts. It's like choking on something that's swelling, getting bigger and bigger inside you...

...and then something breaks inside, and it all comes gushing out. Fiona's arms are around you, and your tears are soaking into her blouse as the sobs rack their way up from the deepest part of your gut, and she is whispering, "Oh child... oh my dear child..."

"Buh-buh-Bobby..." you wail, feeling stupid and weak and scared and guilty and oh, so alone. How did this happen? You were talking to him just yesterday. You snuck out for a lark, and now he's... he's...

"Hush," Fiona says softly, stroking your hair. "I know, child. I know."

I never told him my name! you want to scream. You never told him your real name, and you never told him how you felt about him, and now he's dead, and he never really knew you at all.

But then you remember the letter, and all the things Bobby told you in the Jail... what if he did know you? What if he knew you even better than you knew yourself?

Suddenly, someone pounds on the front door. The sobs freeze in your throat as a voice outside shouts, "Open in the name of Baron Fossville!"

Fiona looks horrified. "It's the Baron!" she whispers. "I didn't think he'd come here so soon... quick, Jacqueline! Go to the laundry room!"

>kiss fiona
Fiona wraps her arms around you and hugs you tightly. Her cheeks are wet against yours. "Oh, child," she whispers. "You've been like a daughter to me, you know."

The pounding continues. "Open up!"

Then the front door crashes open and the mercenaries rush in. Children scream. Fiona stands in their way, shouting something you cannot hear. Scarred arms shove her brutally aside. Theresa points at you, crowing, "There she is!" but the men don't even look in her direction.

The mercenary captain looms over you. His lip pulls back from chipped, yellow teeth.

"You're beginning to damage my credibility, boy," he growls.

And then his fist crashes into the side of your head, and everything goes black.

The pounding continues. "Open up!"

The pounding suddenly stops. Heavy footsteps tromp into the building, making the floorboards shudder beneath your feet.

"Where is she?" growls a rough voice. It's hard to tell from two rooms away, but it sounds very similar to the mercenary captain you heard yesterday morning, at the Grubber's Market.

>sing
You dare not make a sound.

"Where is who, sir?" That must be Fiona.

"Don't play games with me, woman," snaps the first voice. "I've had my fill of it. The old Duke isn't here to protect you anymore, and if one of my men were to be careless and injure someone, it would rest but lightly on the Baron's conscience. Now, we know she came here after the hanging. Where is she?"

"I can tell you, good sir," says a third voice.

Bitter anger wells up in your throat, even as fear turns your stomach cold. That was Theresa!

>l
Secret Closet
It is pitch black. The walls press close to either side; you can barely breathe.

"Widow Theresa-" Fiona begins, in a strangled voice, but Theresa interrupts her.

"Oh, do spare us your indignation, Fiona," she snaps. "I've stood by for years while you protected and coddled that child, and I tell you I've had my fill of it. Now she has done something unconscionable - obviously, or else the good Baron would not be looking for her - and I for one will not stand in the way of the law merely so that you can continue to bestow favoritism on one ungrateful little brat."

There is a long silence. You can feel your cheeks burning. Theresa has always disliked you, but you never thought she would be so treacherous as to turn you over to the Baron's men.

Finally, Theresa speaks: "If you look in the laundry room, you will find a hidden closet in the north wall. The child is hiding there."

"My thanks, madam," grunts the mercenary captain. "I'll make sure the Baron hears of your cooperation when we-"

Suddenly Shannon is screaming, "Jacqueline! Jacqueline, wait!" Shouts. Running footsteps. What is going on? You hear footsteps coming down the hall, towards the laundry room... closer, closer... but then they suddenly turn away from the laundry room, towards... the privy?

"Jacqueline... oh, Goddesses." That's Shannon's voice.

"What is it?" yells the mercenary captain. "Where did the girl go?"

"She... she got away from me, Miss Fiona," wails Shannon. "I was trying to get her into the hiding place, just like you said, but she slipped past me and wriggled out the privy window. You know how fast she can get through that window, Miss Fiona. She could be anywhere in the city by now. I'm so sorry, Miss Fiona, so sorry."

You can't help but grin. You've always thought of Shannon as being a trifle dim-witted, and now you'll have to revise your opinion.

>z
Time passes.

The mercenary captain utters a curse so foul that you actually wince. "Don't just stand there, you bleeding dims," he yells, "get out there and find her! You two, keep an eye on the alley in case she comes back. Go! Go! Find her or I'll have your hides!" The footsteps run back up the hall, growing fainter this time, then vanishing altogether as they cross the threshold and exit Maiden House.

You let out a long, shaky breath.

The door opens, and Shannon takes your hand as you stumble out of the stifling darkness.

"That was too close," she says.

The air in here is filled with steam and the sharp stink of lye soap. Moisture trickles down the walls, and puddles of water splash underfoot. The main hallway lies northwest.

A gap between boards in the northern wall leads into a tiny, dark closet.

Widow Shannon is here, looking scared but determined.

>n
Ugh. You're not going in there again; that was almost as bad as the jail cell.

>talk to shannon
"We can talk later," Shannon says, gently pushing you towards the door. "Right now you should go talk to Widow Fiona."

>go through door
Ugh. You're not going in there again; that was almost as bad as the jail cell.

>** Of course, I meant the door to the hall, the one Shannon is pushing me towards
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>out

Hallway
The main hallway runs through the center of Maiden House, with several doorways leading to rooms on either side. To the southeast and southwest are the laundry and privy, respectively; to the northeast lies the kitchen; and to the northwest is the dormitory where you and the other orphans sleep.

The front door is open.

Widow Fiona and Widow Theresa are standing in the middle of the hallway, staring each other down. Theresa looks sullen but defiant; Fiona is livid with rage.

They are silent for a long, tense moment. Then Widow Theresa looks away.

"Get out," chokes Fiona. Her arm is extended, one pale finger pointing at the front door. "Get out and never set foot in this orphanage again. Perhaps when the nights grow cold you may rely on the charity of your precious Baron."

Theresa looks at you once - a bitter, helpless glare - and then turns on her heel and walks out, slamming the door behind her.

Widow Fiona takes a deep breath, then turns to you and smiles weakly. "Now, then. We don't have much time before the Baron's men come back, and I'm sure you have questions."

1. "You're the tutor, aren't you?"
2. "Tell me about my father."
3. "What will happen to Widow Theresa?"
4. "What do I do now?"

>2
"Then it's true," you say, half to yourself. "The Duke of Toresal really was my father. And you knew him!"

Fiona nods again. "I'm sorry I could not tell you sooner, Jacqueline," she says.

"Tell me about him," you say.

She sighs. "To tell you everything you want to know would take too long, and the Baron's men will be back soon. Please, Jacqueline, there's so much you need to know now; there will be time to learn more once you're out of danger."

1. "You're the tutor, aren't you?"
2. "What will happen to Widow Theresa?"
3. "What do I do now?"

>2
"What will happen to Widow Theresa?" you ask. You're actually surprised to discover that you even care. But you've never seen Widow Fiona that angry at anyone before, and it was a little frightening.

Her face hardens. "She won't have much trouble being hired on as a servant or nanny," she says. "But I'll not waste precious time worrying about the fate of a woman who'd turn a child over to armed mercenaries."

1. "You're the tutor, aren't you?"
2. "What do I do now?"

>1
Suddenly a piece of the mystery clicks into place. "You're the tutor, aren't you?" you ask. It isn't really a question. "The old Duke... my father... he hired you to keep an eye on me, didn't he."

Fiona nods. "Yes, that's right. The Duke had this orphanage built and placed you in it, and he brought me down from Aubrimere to look after you and see to your education. That was almost fourteen years ago, and I've been watching over you ever since."

1. "What do I do now?"

>1
You take a deep breath. "What am I supposed to do now?" you ask.

"First, you must leave this place. The Baron's men will be back, and they won't be fooled so easily again. You'll need to go quickly, out the privy window." Although her manner is urgent, Fiona smiles a bit at that. "It's a route you're accustomed to, to be sure."

She takes a large brass key from her pocket and presses it into your hand. "It's time you learned something of your past, Jacqueline. This is yours by right. It is the key to Red Gate Manor, and it opens the way to your history. Once you are away and safe, go there and find the answers that I can't give you now."

"Finally, when all that is done, go and speak to Dame Sandler in Lord's Market. She is a friend, and more importantly her allegiances are not known to Baron Fossville. She will set you on the road to reclaiming your birthright."

Fiona pulls you close and hugs you tight. "Oh child," she whispers, "I have loved you like a daughter for so long. Go now, and quickly. Be safe."

>hug fiona
Fiona puts her hands on your shoulders and holds you away. "I love you, too, Jacqueline," she says, "but we haven't time for that now."

>x large brass key
You see nothing special about the brass key.

>** Maybe it deserves a custom description (though I grant it's hard to think of may interesting ways to describe a key).
I didn't understand that sentence.

>n
(first opening the wooden door)
"Not that way," says Fiona. "They'll be watching the front door for sure. Sneak out the back, through the privy window."

>take wooden door
That's fixed in place.

>close door
That's already closed.

>** Which makes the "first opening" message a bit misleading.
I didn't understand that sentence.

>go to privy

Privy
Not much more than a narrow closet, with a hole in the floor and a bench over it. At least it's more private than an alley.

A narrow window over the bench provides some ventilation.

>sit on bench
You don't feel the urge right now.

>stand on bench
You get onto the bench.

>go through narrow window
You can't see any such thing.

>** missing synonym

>go through window
Chapter 8 - Red Gate Estate 

You pull yourself through the window and once again clamber up into the alley. You can hear a commotion from the direction of Lord's Market; it looks as though the Baron's mercenaries are still out searching the streets for you, but they'll double back and put a watch on Maiden House soon enough.

There is a scrabbling, grunting sound behind you, and you turn to see Shannon trying to push her way through the window. Confused but not wanting to just stand there and watch her struggle, you give her a hand up.

"Fiona thought I should maybe come with you," she says, after she's finished smoothing her skirts and catching her breath. "In case you needed any help."

Behind Maiden House
This tiny spur of an alleyway runs between the back of Maiden House and the high stone wall surrounding the park. You can make your way around to the Maiden House Entrance to the northeast.

>** Once again, no PRESS ANY KEY message before new chapter heading
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>ne
Shannon lays a hand on your elbow. "Wait, Jacqueline," she whispers. "The mercenaries will be watching the entrance. We'd best cut through the park. I'll help you climb the wall."

>climb the wall
Shannon laces her fingers together and gives you a boost up to the top of the wall; then you reach down and help pull her up. You both drop down onto the grass on the other side, and then it's a quick sprint across the open space of the park. Fortunately, no one is about after the awful spectacle in Lord's Market, and you make it to the relative safety of East Commerce Street without anyone spotting you.

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

Widow Shannon stands nearby.

>talk to shannon
"Can I ask you something, Shannon?" you ask.

"Of course, Miss Jacqueline," she says.

1. "Did you know about Fiona?"
2. "Why is Dame Sandler so important?"
3. "What if you get caught?"

>1
"Did you know about Fiona being a special tutor?" you ask. "Did you know about me... and about my father?"

"Oh, no, Fiona never let on that you were special. Well," Shannon says, looking a bit embarassed, "I always thought you were special, Jacqueline. But that was just my own feelings telling me things, the way they do sometimes."

1. "Why is Dame Sandler so important?"
2. "What if you get caught?"

>1
"Why did Fiona want me to see Dame Sandler?" you ask. "What does she have to do with all of this?"

"I don't know," says Shannon, "but I do know that Widow Fiona has known her for a long time. Fiona had dealings with many people in the city that we never knew about. Sometimes she'd go off for the whole day and not come back until late at night." She smirks. "Widow Theresa always hated that."

1. "Did you know about Fiona?"
2. "What if you get caught?"

>1
"I told you," says Widow Shannon, "Fiona never told Theresa or me anything. We just thought you were another one of the orphans."

1. "Why is Dame Sandler so important?"
2. "What if you get caught?"

>2
"It's very nice of you to come with me, Shannon," you say, "but I'm worried if we get caught by Fossville's men." Your stomach clenches as you remember what happened to Bobby. "I don't... I don't want anything to happen to you."

Widow Shannon pats your arm. "Oh, Jacqueline, I couldn't leave you to face all this alone. And don't you worry - if those mercenaries come after me, I'll run straight to Holstenoffer's shop. I'd like to see how tough they are once they're in swinging range of his cleaver."

You try to imagine an enraged Holstenoffer protecting his lady-love, and you aren't sure whether it makes you want to smile or shudder.

2. "Why is Dame Sandler so important?"

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

Widow Shannon stands nearby.

>unlock red gate with brass key
The lock is rusty and stiff from long disuse, but the key turns... and the door unlocks with a grinding clunk.

Shannon follows silently.

You pause for one last glance over your shoulder at the streets of Toresal, so familiar from your years of skulking, scrounging, and sometimes even sleeping on them. Then you pass over the threshold, into Red Gate Estate.

Entrance Hall
The entrance hall is large, high-ceilinged, and empty but for a few chairs. Your footsteps echo on the marble floor. A doorway leads north to further rooms, and the street lies south.

The house is eerie in its stillness. The walls are bare; and all the furniture is draped in white sheets.

Kitchen
The kitchen seems particularly barren, empty of its usual clutter of pots and pans and utensils. The firepit in the southwestern corner is cold and dark. The dining room lies south, and a wide staircase in the back of the room leads up to the second floor.

Office
This room looks like it was ransacked some time ago. The shelves are empty, and a few books still lie scattered about the floor. The desk is pushed against one wall, the dustsheet that once covered it ripped away. You can leave to the north.

>x books
Most of the books are damaged - pages missing, covers torn off. A few have been nibbled at by mice. 

>x desk
It was a handsome thing once, carved from mahogany and kielwood. Now it is covered with years' worth of dust.

The dust covers everything, muting all colors under a film of gray.

2. "Why is Dame Sandler so important?"

>stand on desk
You climb up onto the desk. You can now see the wooden box clearly, within easy reach.

>x box
The box is about twelve inches by ten inches by six, carved of some beautiful, honey-colored wood and polished smooth. On the lid is engraved the crest of Duke Toresal. 

>take it
Taken.

Most of the furniture from this room has been carted off. Only the bed remains, just a bare mattress covered with yet another plain, dusty sheet. Doorways lead north and south.

>sleep

Bathroom
The walls of this small room are cold, bare marble. The only exit is to the north.

A pair of strange-looking devices protrudes from the south wall, hanging over the lip of a huge stone basin.

>put box in bath
That can't contain things.

>** Strange kind of bath!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>enter bath
You plug the drain and begin filling the enormous tub with water.

Shannon nods with approval but says nothing; somehow she seems to know what you were thinking. By the time you've gotten out of your sodden clothes and into the water, she's managed to scare up a cake of soap from somewhere. She smiles as she hands it to you.

The water is scalding hot and exquisite. You rub the soap into your reddening skin, feeling everything wash clean away. Not just the dirt and the sweat, but everything: the fear and confusion of being hunted for two days straight; the moldy tunnel under Lord's Keep; the prison; the sewers. Even your grief and guilt over Bobby's death - it doesn't go away completely, not all of it, but it's not so raw any more, not so sharp.

You dry off with a sheet pulled from the furniture. As you reach for your old clothes, Shannon stops you and holds out a dress.

"Where in the world-?" you ask.

"The Duke's wife was a little lady, just about your size, really," Shannon says. "Not beautiful, but handsome in her way. And good taste in clothes." She puts the dress into your hands.

>x dress
It's nothing fancy - a simple skirt and blouse of finespun linen, with an embroidered bodice. The sort of day dress you might see a somewhat well-to-do lady wearing to the market. It is finer than anything you've ever worn in your life. 

>* Note, I haven't looked inside the box yet. Maybe this doesn't matter.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>x me
With all the dirt and grime scrubbed away, you hardly look anything like the urchin you once were. You're not Jack anymore; you are Jacqueline Toresal, daughter of the Duke.

>drop dress
You'd better hold onto that; you never know when you might need it.

  a brass key
  a letter

>** Again the "first taking" message is misleading, since I'm not in fact now carrying the old clothes. Can this be dealt with by using BEFORE rather than INSTEAD rules to block the action? I think Before rules run before the carrying requirements rule.

You slip the dress over your head, and Shannon helps you with the laces. The linen feels soft and light on your skin. She was right about the size, too; it fits fine.

Finally, you look in the mirror. A complete stranger looks back at you: fair of skin, with dark eyes and high cheekbones. She wears fine clothes, and the tangles have been brushed out of her hair. She looks, you realize, quite pretty.

This isn't Jack anymore, you think to yourself. This is Jacqueline.

Shannon follows close by.

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south. 

"Well," says Shannon, "I've seen you safely to Dame Sandler. I'd better get back to Maiden House; the Baron's men might get suspicious if I'm gone too long. Take care, Jacqueline." She hugs you tightly, sniffling a little, and then hurries off to the south.

>* Let's see if I can break anything by visiting the shops out of order.
I didn't understand that sentence.

>save
Ok.

>ne
A small bell above the door tinkles as you enter, and a man comes rushing out of the store's back room with a measuring cord in his hands, held up as though ready to begin fitting you immediately. When he sees that you are a clean, respectable, and evidently well-to-do young lady, he practically squeals with delight, clapping his hands and plucking at the fabric of your clothes with soft, nimble fingers.

Royal Tunic
The walls are hung with tasteful curtains, and a deep, soft carpet covers the floor. Several clothier's dummies stand about the room, displaying gorgeous formal court apparel for both men and women. The street lies west.

The clothier hovers nearby, waiting to serve.

>talk to clothier
"I have a question..." you start to say.

"And I have answers," says the clothier, bowing deeply. "Please, dear, ask away."

1. "What's your cheapest dress?"
2. "What do you think of Fossville and the Ascension?"

>2
"What do you think about the Ascension coming up?" you ask. "Do you think Baron Fossville has a chance?"

The clothier raises one (plucked, you suspect) eyebrow. "Listen honey," he says, "I know dresses. That's all I know. Well, it's not all I know. But it's all I'm willing to talk about. Don't mix business with pleasure, and don't mix dresses with politics. That's my motto and I'm sticking to it."

1. "What's your cheapest dress?"

>1
"Can you show me one of your cheaper dresses?" you ask, thinking yourself quite shrewd.

The clother sniffs. "If you want to look cheap, you can buy something from that hussy who runs the silk tent in Grubber's. The question you have to ask yourself, honey, is how much is it worth to you to look fabulous."

You nod, silently wishing you could sink through the floor.

The clothier inspects his fingernails.

>* okay

Chorus Brothers
The inside of this shop is dark - dark wood paneling on the walls; deep, wine-dark carpeting on the floor; even a pair of huge, leather armchairs over in one corner. The back half of the room is hidden behind a wall of reinforced wood, with a wide window cut through the center.

A moment after you enter, two faces suddenly appear at the window, each seeming to slide smoothly in from either side. They look at you with identical expressions of curiosity and a sort of mild, almost professional contempt.

"Good afternoon," says one.

"May we help you?" asks the other.

1. "What was Fossville doing here yesterday?"

>1
Suddenly you remember running into Baron Fossville - literally - yesterday morning. "I saw Baron Fossville leaving here yesterday," you mention casually. "He seemed pretty upset. Was there some problem with his credentials?"

One of the brothers makes a show of inspecting his fingernails while the other clears his throat. "We have the utmost..." one of them begins.

"...respect for Baron Fossville," continues the other. "However, he presents certain..."

"...liabilities. Let us leave it at that."

1. "I have a question."

"...interesting. It would seem you are a personage of more..."

"...importance than first we assumed."

They hand the letter back to you, smiling, and ask in chorus, "How may we help you?"

"I have a question," you tell the two brothers.

It might be a good idea to avoid Grubber's Market for a while. Once they figure out you escaped from your cell, they'll be searching for you everywhere; they looked in Grubber's once, they'll look there again.

East Commerce Street
The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

More people wander past, heading east towards Lord's Market.

>x letter
The parchment is thin and the ink faded, but the writing is still quite legible, a strong, graceful script that flows down the page.

Your Royal Highness, it begins,

It is with a sad but hopeful heart that I write to you, for I must reveal deeds that I am not proud of, and yet perhaps I may thereby put an end to an injustice that has gone on far too long.

My lawful marriage was determined by political expediency rather than by the urgings of my own heart, as you well know. My wife was ever a dutiful companion, but never truly happy. I do not blame her. For my part, I did my best to ensure that she lived a lifestyle fitting for a Duchess, and that she wanted for nothing save my love.

Were this the full extent of my shame, I would have no need to write to you, for a loveless marriage is hardly a rare thing in our kingdom. However, it is to confess yet a further disgrace that I must pen this letter. I was not merely cool in my affections, but an unfaithful husband as well. I took a mistress, a woman on whom I bestowed all the tenderness I was unable to give my wife. And with this mistress, I had a child.

I kept the child's existence a secret, as much to spare my wife the ignominy as to avoid the political complications that would otherwise have ensued. From my private finances I established an orphanage here in the city, and paid a tutor from the Royal College to pose as one of the headmistresses, to raise and educate the child properly. In secret I have sponsored this child for ten years.

I feel it is past time for this secrecy to end. I have grown ill with a mysterious sickness these past months, and I fear that my life will soon come to a close. My wife was never able to provide me with a lawful heir, and yet I would not see my family name extinguished merely because I had not the courage to face up to my failings as a husband.

Therefore it is my wish that the crown recognize this child, who bears no fault for the circumstances of her birth, as my sole and lawful beneficiary, to inherit my title and estate in full upon my death, or upon her sixteenth birthday should I die before she reaches the age of majority. I hereby, by my will and by royal law, and in full possession of my faculties, declare my heir:

           Jacqueline Toresal

Signed and witnessed therewith,

Lord William, Duke of Toresal

Lord's Market
Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south. 

"Well," says Shannon, "I've seen you safely to Dame Sandler. I'd better get back to Maiden House; the Baron's men might get suspicious if I'm gone too long. Take care, Jacqueline." She hugs you tightly, sniffling a little, and then hurries off to the south.

>* I'll try visiting the shops in the wrong order again, though this time I'll hopefully be able to see Dame Sandler.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

A small bell above the door tinkles as you enter, and a man comes rushing out of the store's back room with a measuring cord in his hands, held up as though ready to begin fitting you immediately. When he sees that you are a clean, respectable, and evidently well-to-do young lady, he practically squeals with delight, clapping his hands and plucking at the fabric of your clothes with soft, nimble fingers.

Royal Tunic
The walls are hung with tasteful curtains, and a deep, soft carpet covers the floor. Several clothier's dummies stand about the room, displaying gorgeous formal court apparel for both men and women. The street lies west.

The clothier hovers nearby, waiting to serve.

>talk to clothier
"I have a question..." you start to say.

"And I have answers," says the clothier, bowing deeply. "Please, dear, ask away."

1. "What's your cheapest dress?"
2. "What do you think of Fossville and the Ascension?"

>2
"What do you think about the Ascension coming up?" you ask. "Do you think Baron Fossville has a chance?"

The clothier raises one (plucked, you suspect) eyebrow. "Listen honey," he says, "I know dresses. That's all I know. Well, it's not all I know. But it's all I'm willing to talk about. Don't mix business with pleasure, and don't mix dresses with politics. That's my motto and I'm sticking to it."

1. "What's your cheapest dress?"

>1
"Can you show me one of your cheaper dresses?" you ask, thinking yourself quite shrewd.

The clother sniffs. "If you want to look cheap, you can buy something from that hussy who runs the silk tent in Grubber's. The question you have to ask yourself, honey, is how much is it worth to you to look fabulous."

You nod, silently wishing you could sink through the floor.

The clothier slowly looks you up and down. You get the distinct and not-exactly comfortable feeling that he's "dressing" you with his eyes.

Chorus Brothers
The inside of this shop is dark - dark wood paneling on the walls; deep, wine-dark carpeting on the floor; even a pair of huge, leather armchairs over in one corner. The back half of the room is hidden behind a wall of reinforced wood, with a wide window cut through the center.

A moment after you enter, two faces suddenly appear at the window, each seeming to slide smoothly in from either side. They look at you with identical expressions of curiosity and a sort of mild, almost professional contempt.

"Good afternoon," says one.

"May we help you?" asks the other.

1. "What was Fossville doing here yesterday?"

>1
Suddenly you remember running into Baron Fossville - literally - yesterday morning. "I saw Baron Fossville leaving here yesterday," you mention casually. "He seemed pretty upset. Was there some problem with his credentials?"

One of the brothers makes a show of inspecting his fingernails while the other clears his throat. "We have the utmost..." one of them begins.

"...respect for Baron Fossville," continues the other. "However, he presents certain..."

"...liabilities. Let us leave it at that."

1. "I have a question."

"I have a question," you tell the two brothers.

They nod in perfect, synchronized unison. "Allow us to answer..." says one.

"...to the best of our ability," finishes the other.

1. "What was Fossville doing here yesterday?"

They shake their heads. "We're afraid it would not be proper for us to discuss our other clients' financial matters."

1. "I have a question."

>show letter to brothers
The brothers both reach out, one with his right hand, the other with his left, and delicately take the letter from you. Their eyes flicker back and forth in unison as they scan the words. When they reach the end, four identical eyebrows shoot up. "How very..."

"...interesting. It would seem you are a personage of more..."

"...importance than first we assumed."

They hand the letter back to you, smiling, and ask in chorus, "How may we help you?"

"I have a question," you tell the two brothers.

They nod in perfect, synchronized unison. "Allow us to answer..." says one.

"...to the best of our ability," finishes the other.

Chapter 9 - Preparations 

Dame Sandler looks you over and smiles. She does not seem at all surprised by your change in dress.

"Lady Jacqueline," she says, inclining her head, "how nice to see you finally looking yourself, after all these years. Come, child, let me get a look at you." She takes your chin gently between finger and thumb and tilts your face back and forth. "Hmm. You've simply destroyed your hair, of course, but there's nothing to be done now. It will grow out eventually."

1. "You knew I was a girl all along?"
2. "Widow Fiona sent me."

>1
Dame Sandler laughs, not unkindly. "Oh, child, did you really think I hadn't guessed? It's not that great a secret, you know; more people have had their eye on you than you realize. We've all been waiting for the Duke's daughter to finally make herself known, and now here you are."

1. "Who's had their eye on me?"
2. "Widow Fiona sent me."

>1
"What do you mean, 'had their eye on me'?" you say, all your old suspicions returning. "Who else knew? Who's been watching me?"

Dame Sandler sighs and her expression turns serious. "What you must realize, Jacqueline, is that you represent a threat to certain people with ambitions toward the throne. The laws of ascension in our land are quite clear: in the absence of a named successor, the ruler is determined by the will of the people."

She gives you a long, significant look. "The Duke - your father - was very popular with the common people. Baron Fossville... is not."

Your mouth goes dry, and the floor seems to tilt beneath your feet for a moment. "Are you saying..."

"Yes," says Dame Sandler. "I am saying that you have a credible claim to the throne."

1. "That's ridiculous."
2. "Is that the only reason Fossville hates me?"
3. "How would I take the throne?"

>1
You try to catch your breath, but it's all you can do to keep from bursting out into hysterical giggles. "But that's just... ridiculous," you say. "Completely ridiculous. I can't take the throne, I'm just an orphan, a street girl, a nobody..."

"You are the daughter of one of the most loved and respected noblemen in living memory," Dame Sandler says quietly. "If the Duke were alive today there is no question that he would take the Ascension if he so desired it. As his heir - even as his illegitimate heir - much of that esteem would fall to you. Many would think you worthy."

1. "Is that the only reason Fossville hates me?"
2. "How would I take the throne?"

>1
"So that's it? That's why Fossville hates me and wants to lock me away?" you ask. "Because he thinks I'll get the throne instead of him?"

Dame Sandler looks down at her hands for a long time. "There may be one other reason," she says. "Many suspect this, but few will speak of it." When she looks up at you again, you are shocked to see tears in her eyes. "Fossville may have murdered your father."

Your stomach feels as though you are falling down a deep hole, but on the outside, you are still and calm. You think you should be surprised, but somehow, you know you had been expecting this all along.

"How did he do it?" you whisper.

"Poison seems most obvious," Dame Sandler says, regaining a measure of control. "But no one really knows. There's never been any proof."

You nod. You feel anger, but it's a smoldering, far-away anger. It is something you will have to deal with later. Right now, there are too many other things you need to know.

1. "How would I take the throne?"

>1
"Even if I do have a... a credible claim to the throne," you ask, "what would I do with it? How am I supposed to take the Ascension? I can't just walk around Grubber's Market shouting, I'm the Duke's daughter, vote for me!" You think about it for a moment, then add, "Can I?"

Dame Sandler smiles. "Well, the other thing you must realize is that there are also a number of people who are interested in seeing you succeed, and who can help you press your claim. Some of them may believe that you are the better candidate; more of them simply want to spite Fossville; all of them will expect you to be appropriately grateful for their aid should you actually succeed. It is a very valuable commodity, the gratitude of a queen."

1. "I can't do this."
2. "What do I have to do?"

>2
You take a long, deep breath. Part of you still can't believe this is even happening. But you hear yourself saying, "All right. What do I have to do?"

"Before you can enlist anyone's aid," says Dame Sandler, "you must let it be known that you are in the game, and that you are a player worth backing. You must announce yourself. And to do that, you must attend Fossville's ball tonight."

In spite of everything that's happened, you find yourself smiling at the idea of attending a royal ball.

"Of course, you cannot attend the ball looking like this," Dame Sandler says, her tone becoming brisk and businesslike again. "You will need three things: a dress, some jewelry... and a weapon."

1. "What's wrong with the dress I have on?"
2. "Why do I need a weapon?"
3. "Where can I get some jewelry?"

>1
You look down at the dress you're wearing, the one Shannon found in Red Gate Estate.

"You mean this dress isn't good enough?" you ask, a bit hurt. "Where can I get a better one?"

Dame Sandler smiles sympathetically. "It's very nice, Jacqueline, but I'm afraid it's just a little bit out of fashion. The clothier right next door should be able to fit you with something more appropriate."

1. "How am I going to pay for this?"
2. "Why do I need a weapon?"
3. "Where can I get some jewelry?"

>1
"I appreciate your advice, Dame Sandler," you say, "but how am I going to pay for all this? I don't have any money."

"Ah, but you have something even better than money, Jacqueline," Dame Sandler says. "You have credibility. Go to the Chorus Brothers here in Lord's Market. Show them proof of your heritage, and they should be more than willing to help you with money."

1. "Why do I need a weapon?"
2. "Where can I get some jewelry?"

>1
"A weapon?" you ask. "Why do I need a weapon at a fancy ball?"

"I admit it's unlikely that Fossville would try to kill you in front of a hundred guests," Dame Sandler says drily, "but you can never be too careful. There's a weapons dealer on Commerce Street who should have what you need."

1. "Where can I get some jewelry?"

>1
"Where am I going to get some jewelry?" you ask. It occurs to you that you had a very nice necklace, but then you traded it for a cloak...

"Let me take care of that," Dame Sandler says. She unlocks the display case with a tiny silver key, lifts up the lid, and gestures to the sparkling jewels within. "Take any one you like, child. I'm one of those who would see you succeed; this is my gift to you."

>x sparkling jewels
You can't see any such thing.

>** missing synonym
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x jewels
Which do you mean, the brooch, the bracelet, the pendant or the ring?

>x pendant
The pendant is a teardrop the size of your thumb, encrusted with diamonds and sapphires, hanging from a necklace of delicate, silver links. 

>take it
"A fine choice," says Dame Sandler, closing and locking the case once again.

"I hardly know what to say, Dame Sandler," you breathe. "Thank you."

She merely smiles and inclines her head. "Now hurry - Fossville's ball is tonight, and there's not much time left. See the moneylenders first, then get a suitable dress and a discreet blade. Pieter will go with you-"

Pieter blinks. "What, to the ball?" he asks.

"Yes, Pieter," Sandler says pointedly, "to the ball. Just do what you always do - keep your mouth shut and make sure no one harms the valuables."

She turns back to you and smiles "Go, child, and good luck."

"...to the best of our ability," finishes the other.

1. "I need a loan."
2. "What was Fossville doing here yesterday?"

>1
"I, er... I need a loan," you say, not at all sure how this sort of business is conducted. "You know, money."

The two brothers lean forward eagerly, as though they've been waiting for you to ask.

"We would be delighted to extend to you..."

"...our most prestigious line of credit!"

Over the next few minutes they hand you dozens of sheets of paper covered in dense, tiny script, full of bizarre words like amortization, compound interest, and escrow. Pieter tries to read some of it, with his brow furrowed up and his lips moving slightly; eventually he shakes his head and mutters, "Just sign all of them." You dutifully write your name where the brothers show you.

After it's all done, they sweep all the papers into a slim leather folder, and place a small purse of coins on the counter. "That's it?" complains Pieter, but when you tug open the drawstring, you see the sunlight gleam of gold.

"When you have secured your position, please remember us..." says one brother.

"...not merely as your creditors..."

"...but as your friends."

1. "What would be good to wear to the ball?"

>1
"I'm, um... well, actually I'm going to be attending Fossville's ball tonight," you say, still a bit giddy at the idea. "And I need something to wear. What would you suggest?"

The clothier scoffs and rolls his eyes. "Sister, there's no point in even choosing. They're all good. In fact, I guarantee that if you wear one of my dresses to the ball, no one is going to take their eyes off you. If you manage to find someone who is not treating you like the absolute center of their universe, come back here, and I'll give you a full refund."

1. "Okay, how about... that one?"

>1
After several agonizing minutes of indecision, you point to the dress you want.

The clothier flutters his hands and practically giggles, "Oh, a splendid choice! You'll look like a princess!" He dances around you, taking measurements with his cord and muttering numbers to himself as he goes. Then he takes the dress off its dummy and retreats with it into the back of his shop. "This will be just a moment," he calls over his shoulder.

You look at Pieter and shrug.

"Er, I'll wait outside," he says.

And afterwards, as you look at yourself in the full-length mirror while the clothier kneels at your feet, tugging, plucking, pinning, making adjustments, you realize that he was right - you do look like a princess.

>look in mirror

The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.

Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.

Pieter is here, fingering his sword hilt.

>n
Pieter puts his hand on your arm. "I know you are anxious to visit your father's house again," he says quietly, "but we really should get to the ball as soon as possible."

>ne
After your encounter with the younger Jacobs in jail, you're not too keen on meeting him or his father anytime soon.

>nw
You've already gotten what you need from Fossville's house. Better not press your luck.

>w
Pieter hurries to catch up, doggedly keeping you in sight.

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs east to west, between Grubber's Market and Lord's Market. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east. 

Pieter is here, looking around warily.

>w
"Wait a minute," says Pieter. "We need to get you a weapon first. We can't leave for the ball until you have one."

It would be a good idea to lay low for a while before returning to Grubber's Market.

>** Should the second message have appeared?
I didn't understand that sentence.

>n
"We're not here for food," Pieter says. "We have more important things to worry about."

>nw
"We're not here for food," Pieter says. "We have more important things to worry about."

>ne
Pieter sticks close to you, his hand on his sword hilt.

Armory
The tangy smell of oiled steel is nearly overpowering in this small, windowless shop. All of the really interesting weapons - axes, flails, spiked gauntlets and the like - are high up on racks on the back wall, well behind the high counter. However, there is a display of assorted knives and daggers sitting out where you can get a close look at them.

The proprietor makes a face as you walk into his shop, but when he sees Pieter behind you he quickly finds something else to look at.

>x flails
The sheer variety of ways to grievously injure someone with a sharp, metal instrument leaves you both impressed and vaguely disturbed. 

Olgan Minor's constant staring is really starting to creep you out. You find yourself wishing you'd never entered his shop.

>buy dagger
Pieter leans over your shoulder as you inspect the daggers. "Having the right weapon is as important as knowing what to do with it," he tells you. "You don't want big or fancy; you want something sharp, long enough to do damage to a man when you stick him with it, but small enough to hide under your, er..." he suddenly blushes and clears his throat. "Anyway. That one," he says, pointing to a plain-handled blade about six inches long. "That's the one you want."

Olgan Minor grumbles, but Pieter glares at him again and suggests that if your gold is no good here, then perhaps some other metal might suit the shopkeeper better. Grudgingly, Minor hands over the knife, and makes a show of biting your gold coin to make sure of its worth.

You slip the knife under your gown. Already you feel more confident.

Minor's eyes seem to drill right into you.

>out
Pieter hurries to catch up, looking around warily.

You leave the weapons shop with a sense of relief.

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs east to west, between Grubber's Market and Lord's Market. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east. 

Pieter is here, keeping a close eye on you.

Evening is falling over the city, and the streets are clearing of people.

"The ball at Lord's Keep will be starting soon," mutters Pieter. "We'd better hurry!"

>e
"We don't have time to go traipsing around the city," says Pieter. "We need to get to Fossville's ball."

>w
Pieter hurries after you, doggedly keeping you in sight.

Grubber's Market
At night, the normally crowded marketplace is an empty maze of shadows, abandoned stalls and rolled-up canvas. The Lord's Road lies north, and Commerce Street lies back east.

Pieter is here, looking around warily.

"Are you sure you know the way?" Pieter mutters.

>e
Pieter follows, looking around warily.

Commerce Street
Commerce Street at night is eerily quiet and empty. Your footsteps seem to echo on the cobbles as you walk past the shuttered shopfronts. 

Pieter is here, muttering to himself.

Grubber's Market
At night, the normally crowded marketplace is an empty maze of shadows, abandoned stalls and rolled-up canvas. The Lord's Road lies north, and Commerce Street lies back east.

Pieter is here, shifting his feet impatiently.

>se
You can't go that way. 

>sw
You can't go that way. 

Pieter fingers his sword hilt, as though expecting an ambush from any quarter.

>ne
You can't go that way. 

>nw
You can't go that way. 

Pieter shifts his feet impatiently. "We need to be on our way," he mutters. "The ball starts soon."

>x abandoned stalls
It's a little bit eerie, seeing the whole market empty and packed away like this. 

>x canvas
Which do you mean, the awnings or the abandoned stalls?

>awnings
The canvas awnings stretch out over the market, providing shade for the merchants and customers below. 

>x rolled-up canvas
It's a little bit eerie, seeing the whole market empty and packed away like this. 

Pieter stands close to you protectively.

>n
Pieter follows, looking around warily.

Lord's Road
The wide and well-paved Lord's Road runs from Grubber's Market straight north to Lord's Keep, a mile or so from the city. To the east are rolling pastures; to the west, broken ground and scrub.

Pieter is here, muttering to himself.

>n
Pieter hurries to catch up, his hand on his sword hilt.

Southern Gate
The Lord's Road ends here at the keep's southern gate. Tonight, for the ball, the portcullis is raised; however, the guards are on high alert tonight, checking invitations as each guest arrives.

Pieter is here, keeping a close eye on you.

>n
The guards won't let you in unless you have an official invitation. The way things are going lately, they might well be looking out for you specifically.

"Are you sure you know the way?" Pieter mutters.

>** Since we've just marched up to the front door of Lord's Keep, that seems an inappropriate question on Pieter's part.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>attack guards
Pieter holds you back. "Don't, Jack," he whispers. "You can't beat them, and you won't gain anything by making a scene."

>climb gate
You can't get near the portcullis without attracting the attention of the guards.

Pieter looks around warily.

>** Would Pieter continue to call Jacqueline 'Jack'?
I didn't understand that sentence.

Pieter follows, looking around warily.

Lord's Road
The wide and well-paved Lord's Road runs from Grubber's Market straight north to Lord's Keep, a mile or so from the city. To the east are rolling pastures; to the west, broken ground and scrub.

Pieter is here, shifting his feet impatiently.

>e
Pieter sticks close to you, his hand on his sword hilt.

Pasture
This wide, open field is used by the city for tourneys and other holiday events, or by cattle-sellers driving their livestock to market. Tonight it is empty except for the occasional cow pie. To the north you can see the dark, rough edge of a forest.

Pieter is here, keeping a close eye on you.

>n
Pieter follows, looking around warily.

Stream Crossing
A small stream bubbles out of the woods and cuts through the pasture's north end. The edge of the forest lies to the north, just across the water. The city is far away to the south.

Pieter is here, fingering his sword hilt.

>n
Now that you've had a bit of practice, you're a bit more confident on the rocks this time. Carefully lifting your skirts (you're still getting used to moving around in a dress), you pick your way over the stream with little difficulty.

Pieter, on the other hand, stumbles halfway across and lurches into the water, soaking his trousers up to the knee. You do your best to stifle your laughter as he sloshes his way to shore, cursing and grumbling something about "gratitude" and "youth today."

Woods
You are in the woodlands just southeast of Lord's Keep, following the game trails that wind their way through strands of pale birch and black spruce. There is just enough moonlight trickling through the upper branches to see your way by.

Pieter is here, keeping a close eye on you.

The game trails criss-cross through the woods in every direction, and they all look the same. When you were here the night before, Bobby quickly found a shortcut to the clearing. Where was it?

>w
You try following one of the game trails, but it just seems to wind around without really getting anywhere.

>x sapling
You search the underbrush carefully. At first it all looks the same, but after several tense minutes... you find it! The split sapling that Bobby showed you last night, right next to a trail leading west.

>w
Clearing
The woods open out here in a small, moonlit clearing. The ruins of an old pavilion lie here, pale pavestones poking up like bones from the grass.

In the center of the clearing stands a crumbling fountain, topped by a cracked statue of the Goddess Brigid.

>x fountain
The fountain is shaped like a large bowl, topped with a classical-style statue of Brigid pouring water from an urn. Of course, the fountain is dry now, its stone cracked, the bowl filled with bird droppings and dead leaves. But at one time it must have been very beautiful. 

>x cracked statue
The statue's features are worn away and obscured by moss, but you've seen enough statues of Brigid to know that she's almost always depicted carrying water. She cradles her urn like a child, tipping it gently over the bowl of the fountain. 

>x urn
The urn is hollow, and probably had water flowing out of it when the fountain worked.

Looking closely, you notice a small metal bolt sticking out of the bottom of the urn. 

>pull bolt
The knob doesn't move that way. It feels like you could press it in, though.

Pieter fingers his sword hilt.

>push knob
The metal knob pushes in, then pops out again with a click. Suddenly there is a deep, solid thunk, and a scraping sound coming from the stone beneath you. Just as it did before, part of the statue's base swings inward.

Pieter raises his eyebrows. "Huh," he says, "I never knew about that."

>d
Pieter sticks close to you, his hand on his sword hilt.

Underneath The Fountain
The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.

Pieter is here, looking around warily.

>** It's at this point that it seems odd that we can just march up the tunnel without a light (see comments earlier in transcript).
I didn't understand that sentence.

>** If Pieter had collected a branch as we passed through the forest and was carrying some tinder, he could now make a torch to light the way.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>n
Ducking your head to avoid the low ceiling, you follow the tunnel for some distance.

Pieter follows, looking around warily.

Tunnel End
The tunnel ends here at a blank, stone wall.

Pieter is here, fingering his sword hilt.

>x blank stone wall
Carefully, you run your fingertips across the wall, trying to remember where Bobby found the loose brick the last time you were here.

Ah-ha! You find it - the faint outline of a rectangular hole, with a brick resting loosely in the gap.

>** So, as mentioned before, I should have been able to find it when I tried it before; the fact that I couldn't may mislead the player into thinking that she can't get back into Lord's Keep this way.
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>pull brick
You manage to get your fingers in around the edge of the brick and pull it out.

>look in hole
In the back of the hole you see a short lever.

>pull lever
The lever moves slightly, then snaps back with a click. The wall swings away, revealing shadows beyond.

Pieter looks impressed. "You're full of secrets and surprises, aren't you?" You can't bring yourself to tell him that you learned all your secrets from Bobby.

>n
Pieter sticks close to you, doggedly keeping you in sight.

Chapel
The chapel of the Goddesses is a spacious, octagonal room, empty of furniture. The wood-paneled walls glow warmly, reflecting the light from dozens of devotional candles; the high ceiling disappears in the shadows overhead. A corridor leads southwest, and a secret passage in the south wall leads into subterranean gloom.

Pieter is here, looking around warily.

>save
Ok.

>x devotional candles
The candles sit on little shelves built into the otherwise bare walls. It is traditional to light a candle when offering a prayer to one of the Goddesses; each of these wavering points of light is someone's hope, a wish, a dream. 

>take candles
That would be sacrilege!

>light a candle
There are plenty of candles lit already. You don't have time to fool with them right now.

>sw
Pieter hurries to catch up, his hand on his sword hilt.

Lower Bailey
The lower bailey has been cleaned, with gravel spread over the larger mud puddles. Guests to the ball are still trickling in from the south. The doors to the inner keep stand open to the north, and music and laughter drift out into the evening air. You can enter another part of the castle to the northeast.

Pieter is here, muttering to himself.

>x gravel
You can't see any such thing.

>** But the room description mentions it in a way that calls attention to it
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x guests
The guests are all the brightest, richest, and most beautiful in Toresal. They laugh and chatter and compliment each other on their extravagant costumes and jewelry. Amidst all the gaeity and ostentatious wealth, you can't help but feel a little bit self-conscious and plain. 

"Don't worry," Pieter mutters, as much to himself as to you. "I won't let anything happen to you." 

>*** TYPO gaeity -> gaiety
I didn't understand that sentence.

>x costumes
You can't see any such thing.

Foyer
The entrance hall has been decorated for the occasion, its stark, stone walls hidden behind festive tapestries and garlands. A few guests stand around in groups, chatting, but the main event seems to be in the ballroom, north of here.

Pieter is here, shifting his feet impatiently.

Pieter looks around warily.

You can only do that to something animate.

>x pieter
Pieter is loyal to Dame Sandler and tirelessly vigilant. You've traded friendly words with him in the past, but most of the time he stays quiet to preserve a sense of professionalism. He gives you a slight smile and nod when you catch his eye. 

>talk to pieter
"Hey Pieter," you say, "mind if I ask you something?"

"I don't know if we have much time to chat, Jacqueline," says Pieter gruffly, "but okay."

1. "Did you know I was a girl, too?"
2. "Do you really think I could be Queen?"
3. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
4. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
5. "What did you think of my father?"
6. "What do you know about fancy balls?"
7. "What do you know about this clothier?"
8. "What do you know about this weapon seller?"
9. "Never mind."

>2
"All that stuff Dame Sandler was saying, about me having a credible claim... do you think I could really do that?" you ask. "Take the Ascension, become Queen?"

Pieter sighs. "To tell you the truth, Jacqueline - Goddesses, but it's weird calling you that - to tell you the truth, I don't know much about Royal politics at all. But if Dame Sandler says you have a chance at it, then I'd guess that you do. It wouldn't be the most far-fetched thing I ever heard that turned out to be true."

1. "Did you know I was a girl, too?"
2. "What do you think of Dame Sandler?"
3. "What do you think of Baron Fossville?"
4. "What did you think of my father?"
5. "What do you know about fancy balls?"
6. "What do you know about this clothier?"
7. "What do you know about this weapon seller?"
8. "Never mind."

>5
"Well, Pieter, you ever been to a fancy dress ball, before?" you ask. "What can we expect?"

Pieter spreads his hands in a shrug. "I'm afraid I won't be much help, Jacqueline - I'm not very comfortable at parties. Dame Sandler said you're just supposed to socialize, let people know who you are. 'Make yourself visible,' she said. Whatever that means."

1. "Did you know I was a girl, too?"

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>n
You step into a world of light...

Ballroom
Hundreds of candles spread an unearthly golden glow throughout the hall. From massive chandeliers dripping with crystal, from golden candelabras ensconced in the walls, the multitude of flames flicker like stars. The ballroom is packed with people; all of Toresal's high society seems to be here tonight, and still the enormous hall does not seem full. Servants navigate through the crowds, carrying silver platters loaded with pastries and canapés. Somewhere, a string quartet is playing a lively concerto.

It's breathtaking. It's every fantasy of beauty and riches that you ever dreamed of, brought to life.

>s
The press of people is so close, you can't make your way back to the Foyer without rudely pushing your way through at least a dozen conversations. Besides, you can't leave without Pieter. Where did he get off to...?

>x servants
The servants weave deftly through the crowd, intent on making sure that no guest goes without a drink or a canape for more than ten seconds. 

>talk to guests
You can only do that to something animate.

>** Same problem again
I didn't understand that sentence.

>talk to servants
The servants seem to be doing their best to ignore you.

"Well now, look who we have here," says a gruff voice behind you. "You must be the girl my son helped out of prison recently." You turn and are startled to see a familiar face - it's Jacobs, your former cellmate from the jailhouse!

Then you realize - no, it's not him. This man has the same heavy brow and hulking build, but he's older, more jowly, and his hair is gray at the temples. This must be Jacobs' father, the wealthy and notorious merchant.

>x father
Jacobs is a large man like his son, though age and indulgence have made him less imposing. He wears an ostentatious velvet cloak with a thick, furred collar, far too heavy for the season, and beads of sweat glitter on his balding scalp. His eyes are bloodshot, heavy-lidded, and cynical. 

>talk to jacobs
You are already talking to Jacobs the Elder.

1. "It was the other way around, actually."
2. "And how is your son lately?"
3. "How do you know who I am?"

>2
"And how is your son lately, Master Jacobs?" you ask. "Staying out of prison?" And improving his lock picking skills, one hopes, you resist the urge to add.

Jacobs shrugs. "I make no excuses for my progeny," he says. "He's his own man, and answers to no one. Just like his father."

1. "It was the other way around, actually."
2. "How do you know who I am?"

>2
This man's apparent familiarity with your situation is making you decidedly nervous. "How do you know about that?" you ask, in a low, tight voice. "How do you know who I am?"

He holds up a pudgy, ring-encrusted hand. "Don't bother denying it, I have informants everywhere. I know exactly who you are... and why you were in a prison cell." Jacobs laughs. "Don't worry, I've no plans to reveal your presence to Fossville."

1. "I thought you were a crook."
2. "Then what do you want?"

>1
"I've heard you're a crook and a pirate," you say, suspiciously. "Why should I trust you?"

Jacob the Elder's face hardens. "I'm a businessman," he says loftily, "with many diversified interests. Whatever else anyone may tell you is a pernicious lie. And I wouldn't turn you over to Fossville in any case because there's nothing in it for me. He will almost certainly find out about it soon enough without my help."

1. "Then what do you want?"

>1
"If you're not here to blow the whistle on me, then what do you want?" you ask.

Jacobs the Elder smiles and leans close to you, close enough that you can smell the spiced wine on his breath. "The way I see it, you owe my son quite a favor," he murmurs in your ear. "The way I see it, you'll be owing many people favors before you're done. But if you're to start off well, you'll need to know who those people are.

"Over there for example, is the Queen," Jacobs says, pointing across the room to a woman you can barely see for all the servants and courtiers pressed around her. "She knows who you are, too. Best to not cross her path tonight, though I doubt you'll get close enough even if you try."

He points out a beautiful young woman who seems to be deliberately ignoring the fact that you're staring at her. "And there's her daughter, working the room," he says. "She's Fossville's quarry tonight, but every warm-blooded male with an ounce of ambition will be trying to woo her anyway."

Slowly, Jacobs turns you full circle, pointing out notable guests as they come into view. "The Duke and Duchess of Inhyron, in the Seven Lakes region. An old family, very influential. Insufferably snobbish, as well, but at least they liked your father. And there's the Baron and Baroness of Amhyron. You'll like them; they're a bit less formal, and less likely to hold your lack of upbringing against you. On the other hand, they are utterly beholden to the Inhyron Duchy. Then there's the Earl of Bresa," Jacobs sighs. "A merchant lord from the Kozar Delta. A foolish man with a purchased title. He has all the money in the world, but no power, because he is utterly indiscriminate in how he spends it."

He turns back to you. "Those are the players of the game in this room, and you will have to spar with all of them if you want to win."

1. "Why are you telling me this?"
2. "But what do I have to do?"

>1
"I still don't understand," you say. "Why are you telling me this? Why are you helping me?"

Jacobs the Elder shrugs. "I'll be frank," he says, "you're a long shot. I don't blame you for trying to capitalize on your father's legacy, but you must know that your chances of doing so successfully are next to zero. Still, I didn't get to be where I am today without laying a few coins down on the occasional dark horse. A bit of free advice is no skin off my nose, and maybe you'll remember it if, by some outside whim of the Goddesses, you actually get somewhere."

1. "But what do I have to do?"

>1
"But how do I 'win?'" you ask, feeling a bit lost. "What am I supposed to say to these people?"

Jacobs puts his hand on your arm. "The bottom line, my dear girl, is this: unless you have an army at your beck and call, which you clearly do not, you cannot take the throne by yourself. It's all about how many allies you have, and there is only one way to bring people over to your side. It doesn't matter if they like you; it doesn't even matter if they think you'd make a good Queen. All that matters is whether they think you'll repay them well if they help you."

Suddenly he claps you on the back in a most uncourtly manner. "Well, that should be enough to get you started. Good luck, my girl." And he wanders off, chuckling, to mingle with the other guests.

>* Well, I didn't try this last time, so now I'll try...
You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>talk to queen
With so many people crowding around trying to get the Queen's attention, you can't even get near her.

>x queen
Her Royal Majesty is not a tall lady, and most of the time all you can see of her is a flash of golden crown or silver hair glimpsed between the shoulders of her entourage. But every now and then the shoulders part, and you get a good look at her: a pale, angry-looking woman with sharp, shrewish features. Her tiny face is almost lost within the explosion of jewel-encrusted brocade and lace that geysers up from the collar of her gown.

Then, for just a moment, her gaze meets yours. Her stern expression never changes, but her eyes seem to flash a warning. I'm watching you,she seems to say. Do not cross me.

>** space needed after "watching you,"
I didn't understand that sentence.

>hit queen
With so many people crowding around trying to get the Queen's attention, you can't even get near her.

Servants navigate through the crowds, carrying silver platters loaded with pastries and canapés. Somewhere, a string quartet is playing a lively concerto.

The Earl of Bresa, the Baron of Amhyron, the Duke and Duchess of Inhyron, the Princess and Jacobs the Elder are elsewhere in the crowd.

>talk to princess
The Princess pointedly ignores you for a few moments, then, when it's clear that you're not going to go away, she crosses her arms and snaps, "Oh, you must be that ambitious little street urchin Mother told me about. How charming."

1. "I'm not a street urchin."
2. "You should be afraid of me."
3. "So, do you like parties?"

>3
"So..." You flounder, struggling to think of something to say. "This is a pretty nice place. Do you, uh, like, uh... balls?"

The Princess looks at you incredulously and curls her lip. "Are you, like, actually trying to have a conversation with me?" she asks.

1. "Yes, I am."
2. "Did you know that Fossville is a murderer?"
3. "It must be nice, being a Princess."

>2
You press your advantage. "So how does it feel to be courting a murderer?" you ask. "You do know that the Baron is a murderer, right? That he poisoned my father?"

The Princess looks away, holding one hand delicately against the side of her face as though suffering from a royal headache. "Oh, Goddesses," she moans, "this is so embarrassing."

1. "I know, I know!"
2. "I'm sorry I've made you so uncomfortable."
3. "What can you tell me about the Duke of Inhyron?"
4. "What can you tell me about the Baron of Amhyron?"
5. "What can you tell me about the Earl of Bresa?"

>5
"What can you tell me about-"

"Um, look," interrupts the Princess, "I understand you're having a lot of fun pretending to be someone important? But I'm really not interested in listening to some dressed-up alley rat chatter at me all night. So if you'll excuse me..." And then she shoulders past you and disappears into the crowd.

>x princess

>talk to earl
"Ah-HA!" Earl Bresa roars when he spots you. "The young up-and-comer! The stick in the spokes! The crumb in everyone's eye!" He seems utterly unconcerned that anyone else might hear him - although it seems like most of the other guests are making an effort to ignore him anyway. "Listen," he says, putting his hand on your arm. "I like you already. You need anything, backing, whatever, you just let me know. Now, what was it you wanted to talk about?"

1. "You're willing to support me?"
2. "What can you tell me about Baron Fossville?"
3. "What can you tell me about my father?"
4. "What do you think about Jacobs the Elder?"
5. "What can you tell me about the Queen?"
6. "What do you think about the Princess?"
7. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
8. "What do you think of the Baron of Amhyron?"

>1
"You mean you're willing to support me?" you ask, taken aback. "Just like that? Without knowing anything about me?"

"Young lady," the Earl slurs, "I know one thing about you and one thing only, and it is the only thing I need to know: that you are an insufferable aggravation to nearly every influential person at this Goddess-forsaken party. And that makes you all right by me."

1. "Don't you want anything in return?"
2. "What can you tell me about Baron Fossville?"
3. "What can you tell me about my father?"
4. "What do you think about Jacobs the Elder?"
5. "What can you tell me about the Queen?"
6. "What do you think about the Princess?"
7. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
8. "What do you think of the Baron of Amhyron?"

>1
"I don't want to seem ungrateful," you say, "but that seems like a strange reason to support anyone for the Ascension. Don't you want anything in return?

The Earl flaps his hand dismissively. "Bah! What I want is good food and strong wine, and that I can buy. Why get involved in politics? Why break my back trying to curry favor with a pack of throne-sniffing hyenas who all hate me anyway? But you can stick in their craws in a way that I cannot, and for that, I will gladly back you."

1. "What can you tell me about Baron Fossville?"
2. "What can you tell me about my father?"
3. "What do you think about Jacobs the Elder?"
4. "What can you tell me about the Queen?"
5. "What do you think about the Princess?"
6. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
7. "What do you think of the Baron of Amhyron?"
8. "Good-bye."

>8
"It's been a pleasure," you tell the Earl, "but I should probably go annoy some of the other guests now."

The Earl laughs with his mouth full of hors d'oeuvres. "Spread the love around, my girl!" he calls after you.

>talk to baron
Amhyron smiles as you approach. "Good evening, milady," he says, bowing and taking your hand. "I don't believe I've had the pleasure of an introduction. I am Lord Falton, Baron of Amhyron. And you are?"

"Lady Jacqueline," you manage, "of, er... of Toresal."

The Baron's eyebrows lift slightly. "Do tell. How... intriguing. How may I be of service to you this evening, Lady Jacqueline?"

1. "I'm surprised you don't know who I am."
2. "You look like you'd rather be somewhere else."
3. "What do you know about Fossville?"
4. "Did you know my father?"
5. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
6. "What do you think of the Queen?"
7. "What do you think of the Princess?"
8. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
9. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"

>1
"I'm surprised you don't know who I am already," you say with a smile. "It sometimes seems like everyone else here does."

"I didn't recognize you at first, no," says the Baron, "But I can't say I've never heard of you. There were rumors that the old Duke Toresal had a child hidden away somewhere, but I never gave them much thought. As to why you're here, I think I can guess." He smiles. "I suppose you're something of a stick in Fossville's spokes. Aren't you worried he'll come after you?"

1. "He's already tried."
2. "He doesn't know I'm here."

>2
"I doubt it," you say. "I don't think he even knows I'm here. I kind of snuck in through the back door," you confide.

The Baron frowns slightly. "But he'll find out soon enough, especially with everyone at the ball talking about you. And they are definitely talking about you, by the way," he adds, with a slight smile. "You should probably be more careful."

1. "You look like you'd rather be somewhere else."
2. "Would you support me in the Ascension?"
3. "What do you know about Fossville?"
4. "Did you know my father?"
5. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
6. "What do you think of the Queen?"
7. "What do you think of the Princess?"
8. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
9. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"

>1
"You look like you'd rather be somewhere else," you say. "In fact, if you don't mind my saying so, you're the only person I've met so far who looks as uncomfortable as I feel. I thought a nobleman like yourself would be right at home at a fancy party like this."

The Baron spreads his hands and shrugs. "I'm something of an outsider here, I'm afraid," he says. "Just like you. I'm not very good at idle conversation, and I'm not important enough for anyone to want to chat me up."

1. "I'm surprised you don't know who I am."
2. "Would you support me in the Ascension?"
3. "What do you know about Fossville?"
4. "Did you know my father?"
5. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
6. "What do you think of the Queen?"
7. "What do you think of the Princess?"
8. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
9. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"

>1
"I'm surprised you don't know who I am already," you say with a smile. "It sometimes seems like everyone else here does."

"I didn't recognize you at first, no," says the Baron, "But I can't say I've never heard of you. There were rumors that the old Duke Toresal had a child hidden away somewhere, but I never gave them much thought. As to why you're here, I think I can guess." He smiles. "I suppose you're something of a stick in Fossville's spokes. Aren't you worried he'll come after you?"

1. "He's already tried."
2. "He doesn't know I'm here."

>1
"He's already tried, more than once," you say, proudly. "He hasn't caught me yet."

The Baron's smile broadens. "You certainly seem like a capable young woman," he says. "I suppose it's him I should be worried about."

1. "Would you support me in the Ascension?"
2. "What do you know about Fossville?"
3. "Did you know my father?"
4. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
5. "What do you think of the Queen?"
6. "What do you think of the Princess?"
7. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
8. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"

>1
Something about the Baron's manner puts you at ease, and you decide to take the direct approach. "Listen," you say, "uh, milord. The only reason I'm here is because I need allies. I don't have very many, and the truth is, I'm not very good at getting more, and I'm getting kind of desperate. So I'm going to come right out and say it. You know who I am... would you be willing to support me in the Ascension?"

The Baron, who has listened to you carefully throughout your whole speech, looks down at the floor and sighs.

"Thank you for your candor, Lady Jacqueline," he says finally, looking you in the eye. "I will try to be equally honest. I'd support just about anyone against Fossville. And I would be overjoyed to support the heir of Duke Toresal most especially. Unfortunately, that may not mean very much. I couldn't garner much more support beyond my own single vote, first of all. I haven't the influence."

The Baron pauses, then looks away. "And secondly, I can't oppose Duke Inhyron's interests without putting myself in jeopardy," he says quietly. "He's the one you need to convince, not me."

1. "Why can't you act against Inhyron?"
2. "What do you know about Fossville?"
3. "Did you know my father?"
4. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
5. "What do you think of the Queen?"
6. "What do you think of the Princess?"
7. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
8. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"

>1
"What makes you so beholden to Inhyron?" you ask. "Can't you speak your own mind?"

"Oh, I speak my mind often," the Baron says quickly. "Everyone pretty much ignores me. Or else they smile condescendingly and say how nice it is that the common folk have someone to represent their interests. And so it goes."

He heaves another sigh. "As for why I am so beholden, my family's land and titles were gifted by Inhyron's ancestor. That means he can remove them whenever he likes."

1. "Would that be so bad?"
2. "If I become Queen, I could help you."

>2
"If I became Queen, I could help you," you point out. "I could grant you Royal lands, or something. You could be independent of Inhyron."

The Baron grins wrily. "That would be wonderful," he says. "But you can't make me independent of the Duke until you're Queen. And to become Queen, you'll need support. And I can't support you until I'm independent of the Duke. And so it goes." He chuckles. "I'm afraid my hands are tied, Lady Jacqueline."

1. "What do you know about Fossville?"
2. "Did you know my father?"
3. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
4. "What do you think of the Queen?"
5. "What do you think of the Princess?"
6. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
7. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"
8. "Good-bye"

>2
"Did you know my father?" you ask.

"Not personally, milady," the Baron says, "but from what I understand he was beloved by his subjects and respected by his fellow noblemen. Many people were sorry when he died."

1. "What do you know about Fossville?"
2. "What do you think of Jacobs?"
3. "What do you think of the Queen?"
4. "What do you think of the Princess?"
5. "What do you think of the Duke of Inhyron?"
6. "What do you think of the Earl of Bresa?"
7. "Good-bye"

>7
"I've enjoyed talking to you, milord Baron," you say, and are surprised to find that you actually mean it. "But if you'll excuse me, I should talk to some of the other guests for a while."

"Of course," the Baron says amiably. "The pleasure has been all mine, Lady Jacqueline."

>talk to duke
Duke Inhyron inclines his head as you approach. "No need for introductions," he says sternly. "I am aware of who you are, and I see no reason to incriminate either of us by announcing it." He looks you up and down with only a slight squint of disapproval. "Your father was a good ruler and a good man," he says, "and though I do not think you have what it takes to fill his shoes, he was a friend, and you are his kin. So there we are. What would you ask of me, girl?"

1. "You don't like me very much, do you?"
2. "You were a friend of my father?"
3. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
4. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
5. "What do you know about the Queen?"
6. "What do you think about the Princess?"
7. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
8. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"

>2
"You were a friend of my father?" you ask. You find it hard to believe that your father would have been friendly with this stuck-up chauvinist.

"I counted your father as a friend and an equal," says the Duke. "It pained me to learn of his moral lapse, but none of us are perfect, I suppose. What's done is done, and I do not judge him."

1. "You don't like me very much, do you?"
2. "Don't you know Fossville murdered my father?"
3. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
4. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
5. "What do you know about the Queen?"
6. "What do you think about the Princess?"
7. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
8. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
9. "Good-bye."

>1
"I get the impression that you don't like me very much," you say, making an effort to stay polite and unruffled. "Would you care to tell me why?"

The Duke gives a short, exasperated sigh. "Very well. I do not feel it is appropriate for you to pursue the Ascension given the... circumstances surrounding your birth. I am not partisan; I have no personal stake in who is chosen to take the throne. However, there are proper, traditional methods for going about it. I would see your father's memory honored properly. If you can convince me that coming out publicly as his illegitimate heir for political gain would somehow not besmirch his family name, then I might be persuaded to look more favorably on your endeavors."

1. "Don't you know Fossville murdered my father?"
2. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
3. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
4. "What do you know about the Queen?"
5. "What do you think about the Princess?"
6. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
7. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
8. "Good-bye."

>1
Unable to keep the acid tone out of your voice, you ask, "It doesn't bother you that Fossville murdered my father?"

The Duke looks a bit uncomfortable. "There is no evidence that he did any such thing," he says finally. "Only malicious rumors spread by the Baron's political enemies. Among which, I feel compelled to point out, you now number yourself. You must admit, it would be very convenient for you if it became widely believed that Baron Fossville is a murderer, whether or not such a thing were actually true." He smiles infuriatingly and spreads his hands. "I am merely trying to remain objective. It would be irresponsible of me to not take these things into consideration."

1. "What do you know about Jacobs the Elder?"
2. "What do you know about Baron Fossville?"
3. "What do you know about the Queen?"
4. "What do you think about the Princess?"
5. "What can you tell me about Baron Amhyron?"
6. "What do you know about the Earl of Bresa?"
7. "Good-bye."

>7
"If you'll excuse me, Your Grace," you say, trying a small curtsey, "I think I'll speak with some of the other guests."

The Duke nods politely as you leave.

>l
Ballroom
Hundreds of candles spread an unearthly golden glow throughout the hall. From massive chandeliers dripping with crystal, from golden candelabras ensconced in the walls, the multitude of flames flicker like stars. The ballroom is packed with people; all of Toresal's high society seems to be here tonight, and still the enormous hall does not seem full. Servants navigate through the crowds, carrying silver platters loaded with pastries and canapés. Somewhere, a string quartet is playing a lively concerto.

The Earl of Bresa, the Baron of Amhyron, the Duke and Duchess of Inhyron and Jacobs the Elder are elsewhere in the crowd.

>z
Time passes.

>z
Time passes.

>z
Time passes.

>talk to jacobs
Jacobs raises an eyebrow and purses his thick lips as you approach. "Back for more, hmm?"

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
3. "Tell me about the Queen."
4. "Tell me about the Princess."
5. "Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron."
7. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
8. "Good-bye."

>1
"Since you're not going to turn me in, why don't you tell me more about Baron Fossville?" you ask.

Jacobs chuckles. "I have to admit, Fossville has guts. I don't think there's a person here that doesn't at least suspect that he poisoned your father. Except for Bresa, perhaps," he adds, rolling his eyes. "No, tonight Fossville is sending a message. He's letting the others know that he knows that they know, and it makes no difference to his plans. He's hoping this show of confidence will sway them over to his side."

He takes a long swig of wine. "On the other hand," he muses, "maybe he planned this whole thing just to trap you."

1. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
2. "Tell me about the Queen."
3. "Tell me about the Princess."
4. "Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron."
5. "Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>1
"Can you tell me anything about my father?" you ask.

Jacobs smirks. "The old Duke spent too much time worrying about his subjects, and not enough time worrying about who else might want to rule them. He left himself open. You'd do well to remember that."

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Tell me about the Queen."
3. "Tell me about the Princess."
4. "Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron."
5. "Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>1
"Like I said," says Jacobs the Elder, "this ball is to show his rivals that he has what it takes to be King."

1. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
2. "Tell me about the Queen."
3. "Tell me about the Princess."
4. "Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron."
5. "Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>2
"Tell me about the Queen," you say.

"Fossville thinks the Queen is here to endorse his courtship of the Princess," Jacobs explains. "But in fact, what she's doing is watching everyone else to see how they react to his schemes. She has no qualms about marrying her daughter to a murderer, but not if there's a chance it might not work out for her politically. Of course, the one thing the Queen hates more than anything else is an unexpected hitch in her plans." He smiles and points his chubby finger. "And that would be you, my dear girl."

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
3. "Tell me about the Princess."
4. "Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron."
5. "Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>3
"Tell me about the Princess," you say.

"The Princess is an opportunist," says Jacobs, "and she sees Fossville as her best chance. There's even been rumors that she's been trying to help the Baron raise money. Anyway, I can't imagine she is very happy to see you here," he adds. "You and she are competing for the same position, now. And you know how jealous girls can get."

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
3. "Tell me about the Queen."
4. "Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron."
5. "Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>4
"Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron," you say.

"Duke Inhyron is a stuffed shirt and a hypocrite," Jacobs says with a sour face. "He'd like you to think that he's above all this petty politicking, that he's only here to respect the old Duke's memory, but he's looking for an angle just like everyone else. He has a son of his own, and he'd like nothing better than to marry the little brat into whichever family seizes the throne."

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
3. "Tell me about the Queen."
4. "Tell me about the Princess."
5. "Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>5
"Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron," you say.

"The Baron of Amhyron is that rarest of breeds," says Jacobs, "honest, good-hearted, and an effective ruler. Most folks only manage, at most, two out of three." Jacobs thinks for a moment. "The Baron might actually be a good ally for you to cultivate, but you'd need to tread carefully. The Inhyrons gifted his family their lands two generations ago, and they've never let him forget it. He is bound to support their interests whether he likes it or not."

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
3. "Tell me about the Queen."
4. "Tell me about the Princess."
5. "Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Earl of Bresa."
7. "Good-bye."

>6
"Tell me about the Earl of Bresa," you say.

Jacobs snorts, spraying a mouthful of wine on a passing partygoer. "Bresa is a fat idiot," he says, flatly. "He thinks that by throwing coins about like bird feed, he will create many allies. Instead he creates spongers who know they can get anything from him without providing anything in return. Ignore him; he's useless."

1. "What else can you tell me about Fossville?"
2. "Can you tell me anything about my father?"
3. "Tell me about the Queen."
4. "Tell me about the Princess."
5. "Tell me about the Duke of Inhyron."
6. "Tell me about the Baron of Amhyron."
7. "Good-bye."

>7
"Thank you for your advice, Master Jacobs," you say. "I think I'll wander around and play the game with one of the other guests."

Jacobs nods his head as you leave. "Always a pleasure, my dear girl."

"Pardon me," someone says in a low, strangely accented voice, and a hand touches your elbow. You turn to see a tall, dark-skinned man leaning close to you. "Please forgive my forwardness," he murmurs. "I have been waiting for the right moment to speak to you for some time now, but I fear if I wait much longer, I will never get the chance."

He nods towards the ballroom entrance - where several of Fossville's mercenaries are standing!

"Allow me to introduce myself," the stranger says, as though nothing at all were amiss. "I am Prince Gravesal."

1. "Who are you?"
2. "You've been watching me?"
3. "I have to get out of here."

>kiss prince
That doesn't seem like it would be appropriate behavior at a formal ball.

>hit him
Violence isn't the answer to this one.

>hug him
That doesn't seem like it would be appropriate behavior at a formal ball.

>screw him
That would be less than courteous.

>** To say the least!
I didn't understand that sentence.

>3
"Look," you say, glancing over at the mercenaries working their way through the crowd, "this has been very interesting, but I have to get out of here before those mercenaries spot me."

The Prince seems unconcerned. "It seems they have all the exits blocked, and they're combing the crowd very thoroughly. They will catch you. Why not spend the moments before they do in pleasant conversation, instead of scampering futilely about?"

Even though every instinct you have is urging you to run, you do have to admit there's a certain insane logic to what the Prince is saying.

1. "Who are you?"
2. "You've been watching me?"
3. "Is this about the Ascension?"

>save
Ok.

>1
Jacobs never mentioned this guy, and you don't remember seeing him in the ballroom until now. "Who are you?" you demand.

"Merely an interested observer," says the Prince with a hint of a smile. "I have been watching you from afar, and watching the reactions of others to you. I am intrigued."

1. "You've been watching me?"
2. "Is this about the Ascension?"

>2
"And this has nothing to do with the Ascension?" you ask, trying to keep a note of healthy skepticism in your voice. "You don't have some ulterior political motive? You're not looking for some sort of favor down the line?"

The Prince shrugs. "My homeland is far from here,on the outermost edge of the kingdom. I doubt very much the outcome of the Ascension will make much of a difference to me one way or the other." He looks right into your eyes in a way that makes a lump rise up in your throat. "No, mainly I am interested in you."

1. "You've been watching me?"

>1
"You've been watching me?" you ask. You want to feel offended, but the way he's looking at you makes that difficult. "Do you mean watching me in a creepy stalker way, or in a secretly working for Fossville way?"

The Prince chuckles. "Neither, actually. Of course I know who you are and why you're here, but that's not what intrigues me. There's something... special about you. I could see it from the moment I laid eyes on you."

1. "I'm special?"

>1
You raise one eyebrow. "So I'm 'special', huh? How so?"

The Prince looks away for a moment. "It is... difficult to explain. People in my family have always been able to see these things. It's like an aura." He looks directly at you again. "You have... a highly visible fate."

1. "What is my fate?"

>s
The press of people is so close, you can't make your way back to the Foyer without rudely pushing your way through at least a dozen conversations. Besides, you can't leave without Pieter. 
>** missing blank line
I didn't understand that sentence.

>1
"Okay then, I'll bite," you say. "What do you see in my highly visible fate?"

The Prince looks deeply into your eyes, and goosebumps ripple up your arms as his fingertips brush across your skin. "I see a long journey ahead of you. And many trials."

For just a moment, all you can see are his deep, brown eyes.

"And I see death," he whispers.

The Prince suddenly glances over your shoulder and smiles. "It would seem that your company is desired by someone with greater powers of persuasion than mine," he says. He looks back at you. "Thank you. I hope I will see you again."

He bows deeply; his lips are cool against the back of your hand. And then he is lost in the crowd, as suddenly as he appeared.

A rough hand falls on your shoulder. "Come with us, girl," growls a familiar voice. "The Baron asked us not to drag you out kicking and screaming, so let's not disappoint him, eh?"

Chapter 11 - Baron Fossville 

The mercenaries march you out of the ballroom, through the foyer, and into the inner reaches of the keep. At every doorway you pass a pair of Lord's Guards standing at attention; some of them glare at the ill-kempt and ill-disciplined mercenaries, but no one makes a move to stop them or help you. You are keenly aware of the dagger strapped to your leg under your dress, but there seems to be no opportunity to use it. Not that you'd last very long against a half-dozen armed men anyway.

The last door is not guarded. The mercenaries push you through into a room filled with dim, flickering light.

War Room
A fireplace lights this grim chamber with a hellish, red glow. A huge, round table sits in the center of the room. Hanging opposite the fireplace is a vast map of Miradania, covering nearly the entire wall. An iron-reinforced door leads east.

The mercenaries stand nearby, watching your every move.

Pieter is lying on the floor in front of the fire place, trussed up and gagged.

Someone steps out of the shadows and walks over to stand between you and Pieter. The fire throws his shadow across the length of the room, huge and quivering.

"You know, it's funny," says Baron Fossville, "when I first began planning this venture, I always assumed that you would be the easiest obstacle to take care of."

>x pieter
It looks as though they worked him over pretty hard before tying him up. His wrists and ankles are all bound together behind his back, the ropes digging cruelly into his skin. 

"Poisoning your father, now that was easy." The Baron laughs. "Took a lot of patience. Bit by bit, for weeks and months. So many servants to bribe. But the old fool never suspected a thing. Thought he was only sick until the very end."

He glares at you, eyes glowing in the fire light. "Would that I'd been as patient with you."

>talk to pieter
Fossville's black-gloved hand whips out and cracks you across the face. Stars explode in your vision.

"Please be quiet while I am talking," says the Baron, as calmly as though he were asking you to pass the salt at the dinner table.

Fossville smiles. "But all that's done with now. Once I realized that you were being manipulated into making your own play for the throne-" He stops and glances at you. "You do realize you're being manipulated, don't you? No one really thinks gutter-trash like you has a legitimate claim to the throne, no matter who your father was. Your 'backers' are just using you as a pawn to further their own political ends. Where was I?" He pauses, scratching his chin. "Ah, yes. Once I realized what you were up to, I knew you would show up here. And now this tiresome little game is nearly over, but for a few loose ends."

He holds out his hand. "The letter, please."

>talk to baron
Not feeling too keen on getting hit again, you decide to keep your mouth shut.

"Please let's not draw this out, Jack," sighs the Baron. "Your father's letter, proof of your heritage. I know you have it. Give it to me."

>give letter to baron
Bitterly, you hand over the Duke's letter.

"Thank you," says Fossville. "You see how much easier things are when you're cooperative?"

Fossville holds the letter up to the light, shaking his head slightly as he reads the old words. "Such a nuisance," he mutters. "I can hardly believe it was under my nose all these years, and I never found it. Well, let it be a lesson." And without another word, he walks over to the fireplace and tosses the letter in.

The dry parchment catches instantly, flares up - and it's gone. Your history, your heritage, your one shot at a world beyond the crumbling orphanage and the back alleys of the city - your life - gone in a flash and a swirl of ashes up the chimney. The shock of it hits you like a punch in the gut.

Fossville draws his sword and admires its blade, glowing in the firelight. He smiles as he approaches you, raising his weapon. "And now there's just one last - eh?" He stops, looks to the door.

You can hear shouting outside, the sound of metal ringing on metal.

Pieter struggles weakly against his bonds.

>cut bonds
Before you can move, the Baron makes a gesture, and you hear the creak of leather as the mercenaries loosen their blades in their sheaths. "Ah, ah... no funny moves, now," warns the Baron.

Suddenly the door bursts open - a mercenary staggers backwards into the room, crashes into the table - men rush in, shouting, swords flashing -

Your breath catches in your throat.

It's Bobby!

"Jack! Behind me!" he shouts, slamming his fist into a mercenary's face. He flashes you that devil-may-care grin of his before slashing his way into the room, making a beeline for Baron Fossville.

>cut bonds
Working quickly, you saw through the ropes holding Pieter. "Thank you," he gasps, rubbing feeling back into his wrists. Then he grabs up the sword of a fallen mercenary and rushes to Bobby's aid.

Bobby and Pieter fight side by side, attacking one after the other so that the Baron has no chance to counter. He falls back before their onslaught, stumbles... and then he turns and runs out the door, calling for his mercenaries to defend him.

With a shout, Pieter gives chase. Bobby turns to you, grinning. "Wait for me here, Jack," he says. "We'll catch that villain quick enough, and then I'll explain everything." And then with a bound, he is gone.

At that moment, there is a sudden crack and a rumbling, and a cold draft rushes into the room, tugging at the flames in the fireplace and throwing the room into wildly pitching shadow.

Behind you, the map wall has opened to reveal a dark, cavernous passageway, and more men are rushing out - men dressed all in black, with dark hoods and scarves hiding their faces.

"That's her! Get her!" cries a voice. A young woman's voice. A voice you've heard before.

It happens so fast. Hands are on you, lifting you off your feet, wresting the dagger from your grasp, pulling you back into that dark, dark tunnel. The firelight falls away, shrinks down to a flickering, orange rectangle. The rumbling starts again, and the rectangle grows narrower, narrower...

"Don't worry," says the voice. "We're not going to, like, hurt you."

And then everything is black.
