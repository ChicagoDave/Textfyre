>* The opening seems a bit wordy.  I like it, I think it sets the scene well, I just wonder how it will be received by kids - but I guess you'll have some of them beta test this, too.

>look at myself
Most people know you as "Jack," a fourteen-year-old street urchin of uncertain means. You are slight of build for a boy your age, though your baggy clothes hide much of your physique. Your shoulder-length hair is ragged, a victim of many self-inflicted trimmings. Though usually in need of a good scrubbing, you are an attractive youth, with a softness to your face that makes you seem younger than your years.

 Fortunately, it also leads people to underestimate your wiles and resourcefulness, which has caused more than one stall keeper to call you by your second most common sobriquet, "That Damn Thief!" 

 Only a few people know you by your real name, and you are pleased to keep it that way.

The voices continue. You make out the phrase, "...spread out..."

>* And again, I'm assuming you've thought about whether or not the use of any profanity is appropriate.  I would personally steer clear of it if targeting tweens and young teens... for the sake of their parents approval, if nothing else.

Something - an intuition? - tells you it would be a good idea to stay out of sight for the moment. Maybe if you got some elevation, you could hear better.

The voices continue. You make out the phrase, "...stay out of sight..."

You'd have to poke your head out of the alley to get a good look at them; you only know they're there because you can hear them talking.

Someone barks, "Okay, go!" You hear the jingle of mail and buckles as several heavy pairs of boots tromp past the alley entrance. You're not sure what just happened, but something tells you that it can't be good.

Grubber's Market, Northwest Junction
This is the northwest corner of Grubber's Market. You can skirt around the edge of the market to the northeast or south, or head into the center of the market to the southeast. A wide, paved road leads north, towards Lord's Keep. You can also duck back into the alley to the northwest.

Alley
This narrow alley is tucked away between a storehouse on one side and the canvas wall of a stallkeeper's tent on the other. It serves primarily as somewhere out-of-the-way for stallkeepers to sweep their garbage into, so it's not exactly the most pleasant-smelling place in all of Miradan, but at least no one is likely to bother you here. You can leave to the southeast.

Several crates are stacked up against the back wall of the alley.

You are carrying:
  a cloak (being worn)
  a satchel (being worn and open but empty)
  a hat (being worn)
  an apple

You are still wondering what you should do when a voice from the street calls out, "Hey, you checked that alley yet? Let's give it a look."

Two mercenaries enter the alley and spot you immediately. They approach warily, their arms spread wide.

You're in trouble now...

>run
You'll have to say which compass direction to go in.

>run se
You dash away into the crowd, weaving between strolling customers and pushing your way through the thickest knots of people. The mercenaries pound after you, yelling and shoving people out of their way, but they're too big and too slow, and you quickly manage to lose them.

Grubber's Market, Northwest Junction
This is the northwest corner of Grubber's Market. You can skirt around the edge of the market to the northeast or south, or head into the center of the market to the southeast. A wide, paved road leads north, towards Lord's Keep. You can also duck back into the alley to the northwest.

>* When there's only one way to run, as there was in this case, the game could anticipate that for you rather than asking for a direction.
[Comment recorded.]

>x cloak
Your cloak is made of un-dyed wool, stained and patched in several places. You wear it in the masculine style, fastened on the side and thrown back over your right shoulder.

>x satchel
Your trusty cloth satchel: big enough to hold the things you nick, small enough to not hamper your getaway.

>x hat
You see nothing special about the hat.

>* Add a description.
[Comment recorded.]

>x apple
Round, taut, green at the bottom shading up to red near the stem.

>eat apple
No time for breakfast right now!

Alley
This narrow alley is tucked away between a storehouse on one side and the canvas wall of a stallkeeper's tent on the other. It serves primarily as somewhere out-of-the-way for stallkeepers to sweep their garbage into, so it's not exactly the most pleasant-smelling place in all of Miradan, but at least no one is likely to bother you here. You can leave to the southeast.

Several crates are stacked up against the back wall of the alley.

>u
You nimbly hop up on top of the crates; from there, it's only a short scramble to the roof of the market.

Outer Market Roof
The tiled roof of the storehouse is steep, but there's just enough purchase for you to scramble up to the top and get a look around. From here you have a good view of the market's northwest junction and the gate to Lord's Road heading north.

>look for men
You can't see any such thing.

>eat apple
No time for breakfast right now!

>* But, see, the danger is gone now... so why can't I eat my apple?
[Comment recorded.]

>s
Not a good idea; the rooftops of the buildings surrounding the market are steep and slick, and the tiles have been known to come loose and fall off. It's precarious enough just staying here in one spot. If you're to make your escape, you'll have to make it down on the ground.

Fruit Stall
Bins heaped high with bright-colored fruit lend a pleasant fragrance to this end of the market (though by afternoon it will have become a cloying reek that attracts more flies than customers). Aisles between the stalls lead southwest and southeast.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

>x post
It's one of several posts that support the large canvas awnings stretched above the market square. You can see one of the main support wires running from the top of this post to the top of the high post rising up from the center of the market.

>x wire
The wires anchor the support posts and hold the canvas awnings in place.

>climb wire
They are high out of reach.

I don't think much is to be achieved by that.

A gangly matron with crooked teeth steps on your foot.

>kick matron
That's not a verb I recognize.

>attack matron
You can't see any such thing.

>x people
The crowd here includes all sorts: country folk; poorer townsfolk; middle-class merchants looking for a bargain; servants of the upper class; even a few tourists and sea merchants come upriver from the coast.  All of them are far too busy to pay attention to you.

>* Mmkay, implement 'kick'

Herb Stall
The herb stall is usually a quieter place. Customers like to browse, poke their noses into the various jars and pouches, and judge the potency of a potential purchase at their leisure. You've never understood the fascination, yourself. More interesting stalls are to the south, and the market opens out a little to the north.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

>x jars
Dried and crushed bits of leaves, roots, berries, petals, moss, bark - basically, if it's from a plant, and it smells bad, you can find some shriveled piece of it here.

Rope Dealer
One thing you can say about the rope stall: you'll never spend a moment wondering what's for sale. Rope and lots of it, thick and thin, knotted or loose, in heaps and in coils, stacked on the floor or hanging from pegs. More stalls are to the northeast and southeast, and the market opens out a bit to the northwest.

Rising up behind the stall is a tall wooden post.

The crowd here includes all sorts: country folk; poorer townsfolk; middle-class merchants looking for a bargain; servants of the upper class; even a few tourists and sea merchants come upriver from the coast. Most of them keep their heads down and give the mercenary a wide berth. All of them are far too busy to pay attention to you.

A pock-marked servant argues loudly with a nearby stallkeeper.

>x servant
You can't see any such thing.

>* Again, scenery implementation.

Fruit Stall
Bins heaped high with bright-colored fruit lend a pleasant fragrance to this end of the market (though by afternoon it will have become a cloying reek that attracts more flies than customers). Aisles between the stalls lead southwest and southeast.

One of the mercenaries is nearby, scanning the crowds. 

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

A sour-faced merchant bumps into you hard enough to send you reeling against a nearby stall.

Suddenly one of the mercenaries does a double-take and sees you. "There he is!" he yells, pointing, and both of them start shoving through the crowd towards you.

>kick mercenary
That's not a verb I recognize.

>attack mercenary
Thinking quickly, you elbow the mercenary as hard as you can, aiming below the belt. "Argh! Dammit, you miserable runt-" He stumbles backwards into his companion. Now they're both distracted; now's your chance to run!

>* Implement 'kick' and other attack-synonym verbs.

>sw
You dash away into the crowd, weaving between strolling customers and pushing your way through the thickest knots of people. The mercenaries pound after you, yelling and shoving people out of their way, but they're too big and too slow, and you quickly manage to lose them.

Grubber's Market, Northwest Junction
This is the northwest corner of Grubber's Market. You can skirt around the edge of the market to the northeast or south, or head into the center of the market to the southeast. A wide, paved road leads north, towards Lord's Keep. You can also duck back into the alley to the northwest.

Rope Dealer
One thing you can say about the rope stall: you'll never spend a moment wondering what's for sale. Rope and lots of it, thick and thin, knotted or loose, in heaps and in coils, stacked on the floor or hanging from pegs. More stalls are to the northeast and southeast, and the market opens out a bit to the northwest.

Rising up behind the stall is a tall wooden post.

A pock-marked farmer steps on your foot.

>x post
This is the central post that holds up the system of canvas awnings stretched over the market square. It rises up from the midst of a cluster of stalls in the middle of the market, to a height of about twenty feet. Thick, taut support wires stretch from the top of the post to the four cardinal directions.

>climb post
The stalls surrounding the center post are backed up tightly against it. You'll have to find a way behind them to get to the post.

>steal rope
Better not. Not only do the mercenaries have everyone on edge, but a good third of the normal shopping crowd have been scared off, which makes it that much easier for the stallkeeper to keep an eye on you. And if you got caught, the uproar would bring the mercenaries right to you.

Outside Silk Tent
Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or continue on to other stalls to the northeast or northwest.

Rising up behind the stall is a tall wooden post.

>n

Inside Silk Tent
The fabric walls lend a bit of privacy and quiet from the crowds outside (in addition to keeping dust off the merchandise). Beautiful silk garments hang from racks on either side. The main market lies to the south. A narrow gap in the back leads behind the tent.

"Hello, Jack," says Teisha. "Change your mind about that cloak?" Then she gets a look at your face and frowns. "Something the matter, sweetie? You look spooked."

>tell her about the mercenaries
I'm not sure what "her" refers to.

>* Okay, that needs to be fixed.

That was a rhetorical question.

Teisha brushes a loose thread from the sleeve of one of her gowns.

>* Okay, running out of ideas - if I don't immediately know how to start a conversation, but I'm close enough, the game should tell me what to do.

>* Was just testing there.  I often implement the most common misspellings as synonyms as a way of not distracting the player.

>x teisha
Teisha is a short, busty woman with a smile as warm as her tumbling red curls. She likes you, and she knows that you'd never nick from her stall, so she lets you hang around the stall and look through the merchandise. She also knows your big secret (guessed it the very first time she caught you loitering at the tent flap), which is a little bit scary and a little bit of a relief - it's nice to be able to let your guard down and talk to someone outside Maiden House.

Teisha toys with her measuring cord, spinning it idly.

>Oho - Interesting.
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x silks
You can't see any such thing.

>* Implement that.
[Comment recorded.]

>x silk
Gowns, robes, capes, cloaks, and shawls - their hems rippling with the slightest movement of air, shimmering with that soft, liquid glow that only silk has. You sigh. Dressing up like a boy is definitely fun, but looking at Teisha's wares always makes you yearn for something a little bit more... elegant.

Teisha hums quietly to herself.

>* I know some people think that if implementation runs deep it's because an item is important.  I'm more from the school that things that are mentioned in descriptions should be implemented, even if only as scenery, separately.

>* It helps to build the world.  And if I'm charging money for a game, I'd want it to be as rich a world as possible.

>x measuring cord
It's a five-foot-long length of cord, marked off in ten segments, used to take a customer's measurements.

>ask Teisha about silks
There is no reply

>ask Teisha about mercenaries
"Mercenaries searching the market?" Teisha peeks out through the front flap. "Brigid help us," she mutters, glancing back at you. Although you know she cares about you, you also know that Teisha is a smart, practical woman, and first and foremost she is worried about losing her customers. "All right," she sighs, letting the flap fall closed. "You don't need to tell me if they're after you. I don't want to know. There's no room for you to hide in here, but if you want to you can slip out that way-" she points to the narrow gap in the back wall of the tent- "and I'll pretend I never saw you."

>* Scrolling back to see what direction she's referring to...

Teisha holds the back flap back as you duck through. "Be careful now..." she says, "...
Jacqueline."

Behind the Silk Tent
This is an empty space formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent, meeting at the corners to form a cramped little square. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post, which rises up a good twenty feet from here. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.

>* Maybe the line break is in there for effect, or maybe it's not supposed to be there.  I would say the bold font is enough to set it apart.
[Comment recorded.]

>climb post
You're totally hidden back here, so there's no one to stop you from climbing. By the time you're high enough for people to see you, you're also high enough that no one will notice anyway; no one ever bothers to look up in the Grubber's Market. After a minute or so of grunting and sweating, you reach the top.

Top of Center Post
Perched atop the high central post, you can look out over the whole market square. To the north, Lord's Road heads out of the city towards Lord's Keep. Commerce Street and the rest of the city beckon to the east. In every other direction the city is surrounded by rolling meadows and farmlands.

Attached to the top of the post are four thick, braided anchor cables, stretching away in the four cardinal directions. Their other ends are tied to four smaller support posts around the perimeter of the market, far below.

>* See, I'm tempted to fiddle with these wires, but not to create a diversion so much as the fact that... well, that they *exist*

>* But I'm not sure yet if it's something this character would even do.

The cable is made of thick, braided wire. One end is attached to the top of the pole that you are currently balancing on; the other end is attached to a shorter support post at the north end of the market, far below.

The cable is too steep for you to climb down, and the rough wire would tear up your hands. But if you had something you could loop over the cable, you might be able to slide down while hanging underneath.

You are carrying:

  a satchel (being worn and open but empty)
  a hat (being worn)
  an apple
