Someone barks, "Okay, go!" You hear the jingle of mail and buckles as several heavy pairs of boots tromp past the alley entrance. You're not sure what just happened, but something tells you that it can't be good.

Time passes.

>z
Time passes.

You are still wondering what you should do when a voice from the street calls out, "Hey, you checked that alley yet? Let's give it a look."

Two mercenaries enter the alley and spot you immediately. They approach warily, their arms spread wide.

You're in trouble now...

>se
You dash away into the crowd, weaving between strolling customers and pushing your way through the thickest knots of people. The mercenaries pound after you, yelling and shoving people out of their way, but they're too big and too slow, and you quickly manage to lose them.

Grubber's Market, Northwest Junction
This is the northwest corner of Grubber's Market. You can skirt around the edge of the market to the northeast or south, or head into the center of the market to the southeast. A wide, paved road leads north, towards Lord's Keep. You can also duck back into the alley to the northwest.

>ne

Fruit Stall
Bins heaped high with bright-colored fruit lend a pleasant fragrance to this end of the market (though by afternoon it will have become a cloying reek that attracts more flies than customers). Aisles between the stalls lead southwest and southeast.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

A gangly shopper with a scraggly moustache stalks by, muttering something about "penny-grubbing trinket-sellers".

>x shopper
You can't see any such thing.

>: We should be able to examine a shopper if one is described.

>i
You are carrying:
  a cloak (being worn)
  a satchel (being worn and open but empty)
  a hat (being worn)
  an apple

>trade apple for banana
The stallkeeper takes the apple and looks it over critically, then grunts. "A fair trade," he mutters, "...barely." He hands you the banana - more eager to get rid of you quickly, you suspect, than worried about a few pennies' profit.

>se

Miscellaneous Food
Baskets bristling with loaves of bread; yellow pyramids of cheese; spiced jerky hanging in bundles overhead - a typical grocer's stall. You can continue along the market's outer ring to the northwest or south.

>: We need a knew name for this stall.

>s

Eastern Junction
You're near the eastern edge of Grubber's Market. Commerce Street lies to the east. You can travel along the outer ring of stalls to the north or south, or head towards the market's central hub to the west.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

One of the mercenaries is nearby, scanning the crowds. 

>x mercenary
Rough and ugly, with dirty clothes and mean, scarred faces. They carry serious-looking sword on their hips, and each has a long knife buckled at the small of his back. They eye the passing shoppers boldly; the shoppers, for their part, keep their heads down and try to give them a wide berth.

>steal knife
You tiptoe up behind one of the mercenaries. Your heart is pounding, but the trick to successful nicking is not to dither about it. With one smooth, practiced movement you slip the knife from its sheath, then dart off in the opposite direction, hiding your new prize under your cloak.

A gawking servant squeezes past you.

>x servant
You can't see any such thing.

>: Need to be able to examine any npc, even if it's just "The servant has already disappeared into the crowd." comment.

>s

Hat Stall
Hats of all styles and sizes hang from scores of wooden pegs, surrounding the stall itself in a forest of varied headgear. More stalls lie to the north and southwest.

>examine hats
If you can wear it on your head, it's sold here. Big, flop-brimmed traveling hats; small, leather workman's caps; wide sappans of woven straw from the Kozar delta; fancy, feathered hats for courtly balls; and even a few ordinary bonnets.

>: hmm, do we want to have separate descriptions for each kind of hat? It's not too much work, is it?

>s
You can't go that way.

You notice one of the mercenaries pushing through the crowd, heading your way. He hasn't seen you yet, but he's getting close.

>sw

Exotic Gems Stall
The shelves of this stall are lined with black velvet cloth, across which are spread dozens of jewels in exotic colors and cuts, all glittering in the dusty sunlight. Other stalls lie to the west and northeast.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

Suddenly you hear a commotion from the back of the stall: the crash of a display case hitting the ground; shouts and curses from the stall keeper; and a horrific, gibbering shriek.

"Come back here, you flea-bitten thief!" yells the stall keeper, and for a panicked moment you think he means you. Then you see something small and gray dart up to the roof of the stall... it's just a forest monkey, probably someone's pet running loose. And it's clutching one of the stall keeper's necklaces in its tiny black fist.

The monkey turns and screeches back at the stall keeper, dodges a clumsily thrown dirt clod, and scampers up the nearby support pole.

>: I'm thinking we _might_ consider having the monkey do something differently if you have the banana...maybe stops and gets caught or jumps on your shoulder, getting you accused of being a thief

>: just a wacky side thought

>nw
You can't go that way.

>w

Weapons Stall
The weaponsmith's wares hang from wooden racks along the sides of this stall, a grim picket fence of down-hanging blades. You can find less intimidating stalls to the east and northwest.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

>u
You could shimmy up there easily enough, but it would attract too much attention.

>show knife to weaponsmith
The weaponsmith is unimpressed.

>sell it
The stallkeeper takes the weapon from you and turns it over in his large, scarred hands, frowning. He looks at you, then he looks over at one of the mercenaries swaggering around at the far end of the market, bullying the other market-goers and scaring away business. Then he smirks.

"Here you go," he says, reaching into his apron pocket and tossing you a coin. "Spend it wisely."

>thanks
That's not a verb I recognize.

>: we're going to be adding things like this later...

>n
You can't go that way.

>nw

Leather Shop
You pause here for a few deep breaths - you've always enjoyed the smell around the leather merchant's stall. More stalls lie to the north and southeast.

>buy belt
The stallkeeper barely glances at the coin before dropping it into his purse. "Sure, sure," he mutters, handing you a belt. "Here you go. Now beat it, all right?"

>x leather
Which do you mean, the leather goods or the leather stallkeeper?

>goods
This merchant deals in riding equipment - reins, harnesses, stirrups, and the like. A full riding saddle sits on proud display near the back. There are a few items of clothing for sale as well, mostly various styles of scabbards and belts.

>examine reins

Exotic Gems Stall
The shelves of this stall are lined with black velvet cloth, across which are spread dozens of jewels in exotic colors and cuts, all glittering in the dusty sunlight. Other stalls lie to the west and northeast.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

A sweaty bumpkin shoves you out of the way, muttering something about "street trash".

>ne

Eastern Junction
You're near the eastern edge of Grubber's Market. Commerce Street lies to the east. You can travel along the outer ring of stalls to the north or south, or head towards the market's central hub to the west.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

>w

Pottery Stall
The wares at the pottery stall are spread out on the ground or set on low benches, forcing browsers and passers-by to step carefully around them. There are more stalls to the northwest and southwest, or you can head out to the market's edge to the east.

Rising up behind the stall is a tall wooden post.

>sw

Outside Silk Tent
Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or continue on to other stalls to the northeast or northwest.

Rising up behind the stall is a tall wooden post.

A gawking farmer with an overstuffed basket over one arm shoves you out of the way, muttering something about "street trash".

>n

Silk Stall
The fabric walls lend a bit of privacy and quiet from the crowds outside (in addition to keeping dust off the merchandise). Beautiful silk garments hang from racks on either side. The main market lies to the south. A narrow gap in the back leads behind the tent.

"Hello, Jack," says Teisha. "Change your mind about that cloak?" Then she gets a look at your face and frowns. "Something the matter, sweetie? You look spooked."

>hi teisha
That's not a verb I recognize.

>say hi to teisha
There is no reply.

Teisha toys with her measuring cord, spinning it idly.

>: Teisha has to be a bit more responsive...she's a main character

>tell teisha about necklace
"That monkey got one of Hathid's necklaces?" Teisha laughs. "Ha! Serves the old huckster right. You should try giving it a banana, see if it'll trade."

>: hmm...too obvious of a hint...maybe we could leave out the banana recommendation

>n
Teisha holds the back flap back as you duck through. "Be careful now..." she says, "...
Jacqueline."

Bottom of Center Post
This is an empty space formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent, meeting at the corners to form a cramped little square. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post, which rises up a good twenty feet from here. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.

>drop banana
Dropped.

>u
You're totally hidden back here, so there's no one to stop you from climbing. By the time you're high enough for people to see you, you're also high enough that no one will notice anyway; no one ever bothers to look up in the Grubber's Market. After a minute or so of grunting and sweating, you reach the top.

Top of Center Post
Perched atop the high central post, you can look out over the whole market square. To the north, Lord's Road heads out of the city towards Lord's Keep. Commerce Street and the rest of the city beckon to the east. In every other direction the city is surrounded by rolling meadows and farmlands.

Attached to the top of the post are four thick, braided anchor cables, stretching away in the four cardinal directions. Their other ends are tied to four smaller support posts around the perimeter of the market, far below.

Balancing on one of the wires is that monkey.

>x monkey
It has silvery fur and black mask-like markings on its startlingly human face. It seems to regard you with a mixture of curiosity and amusement - as though you were some strange little animal whose antics it found entertaining. It grips the necklace protectively, tight against its tiny chest.

The monkey sniffs at you and shrieks with amusement.

>get monkey
The monkey screams and jumps away from you, chattering with rage and shaking its tiny fist.

>get necklace
The monkey hops back a few feet on the wire and blows a raspberry at you, as though daring you to come after it.

>x monkey

The monkey bounces up and down on its wire, screeching happily.

>which wire is monkey on?
That's not a verb I recognize.

>x wire
Which do you mean, the north cable, the south cable, the east cable or the west cable?

>north cable
The cable is made of thick, braided wire. One end is attached to the top of the pole that you are currently balancing on; the other end is attached to a shorter support post at the north end of the market, far below.

The monkey turns the necklace over and over in its tiny hands, staring intently into the gem's blue depths.

>slide down monkey cable
I only understood you as far as wanting to slide down the monkey.

>: we need to know which cable the monkey is on...the player should be able to slide down that cable and chade the monkey...of course the monkey will probably just hop over the belt, but that should be possible

>: chase

Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post, which rises up a good twenty feet from here. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.

You can see a banana here.

>get banana
Taken.

>u

By the time you're high enough for people to see you, you're also high enough that no one will notice anyway; no one ever bothers to look up in the Grubber's Market.

Attached to the top of the post are four thick, braided anchor cables, stretching away in the four cardinal directions. Their other ends are tied to four smaller support posts around the perimeter of the market, far below.

Balancing on one of the wires is that monkey. The monkey sniffs the air excitedly as you come closer, and emits a hopeful chirp.

>show banana to monkey
The monkey is unimpressed.

The monkey sniffs at you excitedly, and emits a hopeful chirp.

>: I think the monkey _is_ impressed!

>give banana to monkey
You hold out the banana and wiggle it enticingly. "Here, monkey. C'mon, little monkey," you whisper, trying to ignore how stupid it sounds.

The monkey creeps closer, eyes locked on the yellow fruit. It's only about a foot away from your out-stretched hand now. It's little face contorts into bizarre expressions as it wrestles with the conflicting desires to grab the tasty treat, hold onto the shiny trinket, and stay out of your reach, all at the same time.

Suddenly the monkey lunges. You make with your free hand. The monkey grabs the banana just as your fingers hook around the necklace's chain. The monkey screams and jumps six feet straight up, lands on your head, and scampers off down the wire behind you. Your heart leaps into your throat as you lose your balance on top of the pole. You totter, pinwheel your arms... and stay on.

You're breathing hard, but you're safe. And you have the necklace.

Somewhere far below you, a stallkeeper is cursing and wiping smushed banana off his face.

>: You make with your free hand?

Silk Stall
The fabric walls lend a bit of privacy and quiet from the crowds outside (in addition to keeping dust off the merchandise). Beautiful silk garments hang from racks on either side. The main market lies to the south. A narrow gap in the back leads behind the tent.

Teisha looks up. "Hi Jack. Hanging in there?"

>: maybe teisha has watched what we just did (if she knows about the monkey and the necklace) and comments about it

>: maybe she shows a little greed

>show necklace to teisha
"Ooh, a nice one," Teisha says, taking a close look at the gem. "That monkey has good taste."  She glances over at her rack of cloaks. "I might be able to trade something for it, if you like."

>: again, showing a glint of greed

>trade necklace
(for the silk garments)
Teisha's eyebrow shoots up when you show her the necklace, but she manages to hide her excitement with the coolness of a professional haggler. "Not top quality," she mutters, "but very nice..." She gives you a look. "Now, tell me the truth, Jack, you didn't just steal this from somewhere, did you?"

You shake your head proudly. It's not exactly a lie.

"All right." The necklace disappears into one of Teisha's pockets. "Let's see..." she starts searching through the clothes on the racks, looking for something in your size. "This should fit. I think it suits you, too." She holds out a girl's cloak, simple but elegant. "What do you think?"

It's beautiful. Eagerly you nod your agreement.

Teisha smiles. "Then it's yours."

>: she may know where we got it

>: the cloak is green...see Erika's drawing

>thanks
That's not a verb I recognize.

>: politeness should be rewarded

>: player sees a card!

>: or maybe not yet!

>n
"Careful out there," calls Teisha as you duck through the back again.

Attached to the top of the post are four thick, braided anchor cables, stretching away in the four cardinal directions. Their other ends are tied to four smaller support posts around the perimeter of the market, far below.

>slide down east cable with belt
You wrap one end of the belt around your hand and sling the supple leather over the anchor cable. Then, after giving it one more good yank to test your grip, you push off.

The wind is exhilarating as you zip down the line to the ground below. Several people look up, including the mercenaries. Shouts ring out and fingers point. You hit the support post with your feet, let go of the belt, and drop to the ground next to the eastern junction, slightly breathless. Not everyone saw where you landed - most people are still staring up at the wires. You've only got a few moments while the guards' chins are still in the air. Better make the most of them.

Eastern Junction
You're near the eastern edge of Grubber's Market. Commerce Street lies to the east. You can travel along the outer ring of stalls to the north or south, or head towards the market's central hub to the west.

Nearby stands a thick wooden post.

>wear cloak
Which do you mean, the green silk cloak or the gray cloak?

>green
(first taking off the gray cloak)
You take off the gray cloak.

You slip the cloak around your shoulders, fastening it just under your neck in the feminine style and drawing the edges together to hide your clothes. If you took your cap off, you'd look just like a young girl, albeit one with a very uneven haircut.

>remove hat
You take off the hat.

>e
You keep your head down and walk at a steady pace - not too fast, not too slow. The mercenaries posted at the market's entrance aren't paying attention: they're looking over your head at the market, trying to see what the big commotion is under the awnings.

You hold your breath as you walk past, close enough to touch one of them. No one stops you. Five more steps...four...three...

And then you are past them, out of Grubber's Market and into Commerce Street and the inner city.

Grubber's Market Eastern Edge
Grubber's market is to the west, along with the searching mercenaries. Commerce Street beckons to the east.

>: onto?

>: this location is for testing I assume...we don't need it, right?

>e
You let out a long, shaky breath. You're safe now. Commerce Street is home to a slightly more upscale class of merchant, and business here is not quite as frantic as in Grubber's Market. Transactions tend to be calmer, more deliberate, and involve significantly more money. The Lord's Guard will be far less tolerant of a pack of armed bullies menacing the citizens of the upper class, so it's unlikely that the mercenaries will follow you here. And even if they did, there are too many streets and side alleys for them to block off your escape.

Now it's time to pause, catch your breath, and try to figure out why they were after you in the first place.

Commerce Street
Commerce Street runs from Grubber's Market, to the west, to Lord's Market to the east. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east.

>wear hat
You pull the cap down over your head and stuff your hair up into it.

>wear gray
(first taking off the green silk cloak)
You take off the green silk cloak.

You put on the gray cloak.
