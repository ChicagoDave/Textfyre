[wcp] Jacqueline says, "I guess it's safe to say that at this point I'm just listening for more information, because I don't agree with everything, in particular regarding the lower-level quality you mentioned.  And to get this thing off the ground and running effectively will take the commitment of a number of people working many hours - full time job sort of hours - which I doubt many talented people have."
[wcp] Dave says, "Inform 7 and a few other factors have driven me to push harder"
[wcp] Dave says, "well, when I say "lower quality", I don't mean crap...I still mean well written, thoroughly tested, and entertaining software"
[wcp] Dave says, "I just don't think my view of "quality" is the same as the communities"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "Well, there's enough shit out there.  No respectable commercial IF entity would want to contribute to that further."
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "I'd be curious to see what the level you mean is, then."
[wcp] Dave says, "the most important point you make is that I can't do this alone"
[wcp] Dave says, "but that's my main job....to convince other people to sign onto it and be committed"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "No.  You need divisions of people - writers, programmers, testers, etc."
[wcp] Dave says, "and I think I can find those people"
[wcp] Dave says, "not at first...at first I just need a few people"
[wcp] Jacqueline asks, "You think?"
[wcp] Jacqueline asks, "Even if you plan an episodic sort of thing?"
[wcp] Dave says, "because if I open, have several worlds defined, several games for release, and a website up....generate some revenue....getting other people on-board will become an easier task"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "The only way to do that with regularity with just a few people is to build up a bunch of stuff before the first release, then pray that the extra episodes buy you enough time to keep turning them out."
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "Okay, timing."
[wcp] Jacqueline asks, "So, you're envisioning this as CYOA-level kids stuff?"
[wcp] Dave says (to jacqueline), "I haven't restricted my discussion to the IF community...I've run my overview past several publishers and people in the education world and they all say the same thing...."Wow - we desperately need this kind of content.""
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "huh"
[wcp] Dave says, "it's my belief that the market is _ripe_ for quality interactive edutainment"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "Well, it is, but it's a point and click world these days, Dave."
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "Adults may think it's ripe, kids may think something different."
[wcp] Dave says, "parents buy software"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "But only if their kids will use it."
[wcp] Dave says, "I'm betting I can sell gobs of games to parents that are _sick_ of movie related junk that the video game industry puts out"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "You need repeat sales."
[wcp] Dave says, "well that's why one of my primary focuses is to create worlds that are known and reusable...there has to be some draw for return customers"
[wcp] Dave says, "Star Wars didn't generate billions because of the plots....it was the world model and characters"
[wcp] DavidW says, "'Worlds'. I can't see that in a Z-machine. Glulx, perhaps."
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "So, like, this advert for someone with very solid C++ skills and knowledge of the Trolltech Qt framework... are you already at the point of offering to pay a person?  It's going to be difficult to garner volunteers for high levels of commitment."
[wcp] Dave says, "yes - I'm capable of paying for that work"
[wcp] Dave says, "but not a ton of cash, no"
[wcp] Dave says, "my best proposal so far is a highly qualified Indian guy that offered to do it for $7500"
[wcp] DavidW says, "Dangerous Curves was supposed to be the first game in a shared world, but it barely fit in the Z-machine, and the author had to cut several options out."
[wcp] Dave says (to davidw), "I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing"
[wcp] DavidW says, "Maybe not."
[wcp] Dave says, "the size of the game has nothing to do with "worlds""
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "It might if they're well-fleshed out, Dave."
[wcp] Dave says, "i think it may be necessary to have a lot of backstory written into the website and as a comic book that comes with the game CD"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "I could see how episodic releases might be possible if the world was programmed first, and the plots placed in later, with the same world as a template each time."
[wcp] Dave says, "well, by "world" I only mean the same world geogaphy and natural laws"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "So you'd rely on a lot of non-interactive stuff to do your backstory?  I wouldn't be interested - I'd want to dive right into the world and learn/explore for myself."
[wcp] Dave says, "each game may or may not have an entirely different setting"
[wcp] Dave says (to jacqueline), "you're not my target audience :)"
[wcp] Dave says, "my target audience is 8 to 14 years old"
[wcp] DavidW says, "ah. So that 'boy'/'girl' was an age expression."
[wcp] Dave says, "basically, my target audience is the Harry Potter audience"
[wcp] Dave says, "but that's really premature"
[wcp] Jacqueline says (to Dave), "I would have been even less interested in static backstory when I was a kid - kids don't have the attention span adults do."
[wcp] Dave says, "as I stated in one of the posts, I need to build a couple of test games and head to the mall on a Saturday night for some feedback"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "Kids are going to be, "Like, get to the game already.""
[wcp] Dave says, "i'm not saying that the non-game content is required...it will just be additional information"
[wcp] Dave says, "sort of like the 30,000ft view of the world where the game takes you down to ground level"
[wcp] Dave says, "and one of the ways back story is added is with NPC conversation and things like in-game libraries"
[wcp] Dave says, "I will definitely use that sort of thing"
[wcp] Dave says, "and I plan to target Glulx anyway"
[wcp] Jacqueline nods.
[wcp] Dave says, "I agree that my games will stretch z8 not because of the number of objects or rooms...but because of the amount of dialogue and detailed responses I want"
[wcp] Dave says, "but again, this is premature...I have to build a few games and do research..."
[wcp] Dave says, "but I also need the terp because that's part of the experience"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "I thought I7 and Glulx weren't jiving yet."
[wcp] Dave says, "I want to show people _exactly_ how it will look when its released"
[wcp] Dave says, "Glulx will be viable by the time I need it"
[wcp] Jacqueline asks, "So it'll be bundled with an interface/terp... something with its own look?"
[wcp] Dave says, "look at the posts - the functional design for the terp shows a picture"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "Well, I've read the posts.  Haven't seen the pdf yet, but I did download it.  One sec."
[wcp] Dave says, "http://placet.com/wczplayer.pdf"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "Okay, that's the one I downloaded."
[wcp] DavidW says, "I had some um-but's about that pic, but I didn't want to be negative right away."
[wcp] Dave says, "well, I don't like the compass rose"
[wcp] Dave says, "the buttons aren't what I'd hoped for either"
[wcp] Dave says, "but in general, I like the scroll for a window"
[wcp] Dave says, "at least for an adventure type game"
[wcp] DavidW says, "Well, the scroll is the wrong direction, for one thing. The scrolling of text is up, the picture scrolls right."
[wcp] Dave says, "yeah, that bugs me too"
[wcp] DavidW says, "And I don't see where the scroll bar goes. I assume a scroll bar should go in there somewhere."
[wcp] Dave says (to dw), "yeah, it's just a "prototype" GUI mock up...I only paid $120 for the whole thing"
[wcp] Dave says, "I'll have a pro do a much better design later on"
[wcp] DavidW says, "And resizing. Or a standard menubar for changing fonts or other options."
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "Hm.  Yes, initially I like that."
[wcp] Dave says, "i won't have a menubar"
[wcp] DavidW asks, "Why on earth not?"
[wcp] Dave asks, "you don't get to choose the font for a book you buy, do you?"
[wcp] DavidW says, "It's not a book."
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "I agree with David here, I think."
[wcp] Dave says, "i will choose a nice readable font for you"
[wcp] DavidW asks, "How do you know it's readable for *me*?"
[wcp] Dave says, "again, the average 8 to 14 year old won't even know how to spell F-O-N-T"
[wcp] Jacqueline says, "Some degree of user-based friendliness might be nice and un-corporatelike of you."
[wcp] Jacqueline says (to Dave), "Hm, well, you have a point there."
[wcp] Dave says, "well, my argument is simplification"
[wcp] Dave says, "but I might be persuaded on this point"
[wcp] Dave says, "but I might add it as an easter egg feature"
[wcp] DavidW says, "These kids make websites and use instant messaging and so on. They will want to arrange their screen as they like and multitask."
[wcp] Dave says, "like if you triple-click on the title bar it brings up an options menu"
[wcp] Dave says (to davidw), "I'd argue that only the older kids (15-16 and up) are doing that stuff"
[wcp] DavidW says, "well, that's ageist of you."
[wcp] Dave says, "but like I said, I think you're giving most kids too much credit for caring about fonts..._you_ care....I highly doubt they will...and for me...it's about presentation...I may want to use a particular font as part of the presentation"
[wcp] Dave says, "this is where putting it in front of kids matters...if I survey 200 kids and 5 ask me about changing the font I might put the easter egg in....if 50 ask me it's definitely in...if 150 ask me it's a full on feature of the interface labelled Change Font Here"
[wcp] Dave says, "my guess is that the number of requests to change the font will be 0"
[wcp] Jacqueline nods.  "Fair enough."
[wcp] DavidW says, "Not really, but I've said my peace on it."
