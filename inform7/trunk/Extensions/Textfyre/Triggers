Version 1 of Triggers by Textfyre begins here.

"A design pattern shared by several other Textfyre extensions including Quips,
Scripted Events, Conversation Topics and Counters."

Part 1 - Definitions

A trigger is a kind of thing. 

A trigger can be fired or unfired. A trigger is usually unfired.

Firing something is an activity.

Last after firing something (called the certain trigger):
	now the certain trigger is fired;

To fire (t - a trigger):
	carry out the firing activity with t.

To say fire (t - a trigger):
	fire t;

Triggers ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ---- 

A trigger begins life unfired, and then at some point it is fired.

This simple idea lends itself well to a general class of events that behave differently the first time they occur, to subsequent times. Typically, the first firing will display a verbose description, while subsequent firings may display only an abbreviated one. Alternatively, a trigger may behave as a one-shot, guaranteed only to occur once.

This extension defines the Trigger kind, intended to be subclassed.

All triggers inherit the either/or property, unfired or fired.

This extension also defines the firing activity, which is carried out whenever a trigger is fired. Only one rule is attached to this activity, and - in a change from standard procedure - it is placed in the 'after firing' rulebook to ensure it is not overlooked: all it does is set the fired property.
