    [ this section intentionally left blank ]


Book 1 - Initialization

Part 1 - Set up

Chapter 1 - odds and ends

Section 1 - expand memory limits

Use MAX_STATIC_DATA of 400000.
Use MAX_OBJECTS of 1024.
Use MAX_DICT_ENTRIES of 2500.
Use MAX_PROP_TABLE_SIZE of 350000.

Use MAX_LABELS of 30000.
Use MAX_ARRAYS of 2000.
Use MAX_NUM_STATIC_STRINGS of 30000.

Section 2 - debugging aids

Use numbered rules.

Section 3 - teleport to a room - not for release

Understand "teleport [any room]" or "teleport to [any room]" as teleporting to. Teleporting to is an action out of world applying to one visible thing. Check teleporting to the location: say "[bracket]Asserted being at [the noun].[close bracket][line break]" instead. Carry out teleporting to: move the player to the noun. 

Section 4 - minor programming aids

To say try (act - an action) -- running on:  (- RunParagraphOn();  meta = 0; {act}; RunParagraphOn(); -).  [from Understand as Mistake, the whole action will be done out  of world]

[used within "Understand...as a mistake" and Ask About replies to effect how-to-play instructions and gamestate change. Very handy.]


When play begins:
	change the looking action to out of world;
	change the taking inventory action to out of world.

To change (act - an action-name) to out of world: (- MakeOOW({act}); -).

Include (- 
[ MakeOOW act  at;
    at = FindAction(act); 
    ActionData-->(at+AD_REQUIREMENTS) = ActionData-->(at+AD_REQUIREMENTS) | OUT_OF_WORLD_ABIT;
];-).

[deprecated in 6E59, but so darn useful]
To decide whether in (R - a room): decide on whether or not the location is R.
To decide whether in (R - a region): decide on whether or not the location is R.
To decide whether in (R - a container): decide on whether or not the location is R.


Chapter 2 - cribbed from extension Mentioned In Room Descriptions

The initialise locale description rule is not listed in the before printing the locale description rules.

The initialise locale description rule is listed first in the carry out looking rules.

First before printing the locale description of something while not looking (this is the initialise non-look locale description rule):
	consider the initialise locale description rule.

The don't mention player's supporter in room descriptions rule is not listed in any rulebook. [ unnecessary now that "mentioned" is initialized so early. ]
	
To say (x - an object) mentioned: now x is mentioned; if x is a scenery supporter, now everything supported by x is mentioned. [useful for combining several people into the room description:  see Ava&Stacy at the ping-pong room]

Chapter 3 - Banner Text

Rule for printing the banner text:
	select the title channel;
	say "[b][story title][r][line break]";
	select the credits channel;
	say "[story title] by [story author][line break]";
	say "Copyright [story creation year] by [story author][line break]";
	say "Designed by Paul O'Brian[line break]";
	say "Written by Christopher Huang[line break]";
	say "Game Engine (FyreVM) by Jesse McGrew[line break]";
	say "Inform 7 Programming by Ron Newcomb[line break] and Graeme Jefferis[line break]";
	say "Testing by ____[line break]";
	say "Special thanks to Graham Nelson and Emily Short[line break]";
	say "for all of their hard work on Inform 7.[line break]";
	say "All rights reserved.[line break]";

Chapter 4 - Passage of Time

Section 1 - in-fiction time

A term day is a kind of value. Day 10 specifies a term day.

The current term day is a term day that varies. The current term day is Day 2.

When play begins:
	now the left hand status line is "[Current term day]: [the location in title case]";
	now the right hand status line is "[time of day]".

Section 2 - narrative time

The chapter number is a number that varies. The chapter number is usually 1. 

[OUTLINE
Chapter 1 - Scavenger Hunting
Chapter 2 - Lucian's Secret (incl. the bullies, Crystal Quest)
Chapter 3 - Here Comes the Flood (incl. Lost in Maelstrom)
Chapter 4 - Hospital (incl. Cased In, Doc Rose Chat, Hospital Chat, Outward Journey, Return Journey) 
Chapter 5 - Robot Fun
Chapter 6 - Not So Merry Ol' England
Chapter 7 - Lucian's Bad Day (Ava gets Daniel's help, tracking Lucian, coaxing Lucian out of the vents, Saving Lucian from Aidan)
Chapter 8 - Night Terrors
Chapter 9 - The Poisoned Mind (.. the Battle with the Thief)
Chapter 10 - Breakfast of Champions
]

To decide whether in chapter/chapters (N - a number): decide on whether or not the chapter number is N.
To decide whether in chapters/chapter (N - a number) through/thru/thorugh (M - a number): decide on whether or not the chapter number is at least N and the chapter number is not greater than M.

To Go straight to section (txt - some text) in Chapter 09 text: placeholder "Go straight to section ['][txt]['] in Chapter 09 text."


section 3 - CHAPTER testing command - not for release
	
Understand "chapter" as a mistake ("Currently in chapter [the chapter number]."). Understand "chapter [number]" as a mistake ("Now pretending we're in chapter [set chapter number to number understood][the chapter number]."). To say set chapter number to (N - a number): now the chapter number is N; if the chapter number > 10, now the chapter number is 10; if the chapter number < 1, now the chapter number is 1.

Understand "puzzle [number]" as a mistake ("[set puzzle-touch to 7]"). To say set puzzle-touch to (n - number): now puzzle-touch is n. Puzzle-touch is a number that varies. [scenes begin on this number]


Chapter 5 - What does ALL mean

Section 1 - TAKE ALL ALL to test messages - not for release

Rule for deciding whether all includes scenery when the player's command includes "all all": it does.


Chapter 6 - Convert Telling and Answering to Asking

Replaceable-action-name is an action name that varies. Replaceable-action-name variable translates into I6 as "action".

First before telling it about: now the Replaceable-action-name is the asking it about action.
First before answering: now the Replaceable-action-name is the asking it about action.

[these actions are hard-coded into the inform parser, so using "Understand the command.... as something new." won't work. Changing the action produces better performance than re-trying a whole new action.]



Part 2 - The player

Chapter 1 - Description

The description of yourself is "[placeholder]A description of the player[end placeholder]."

The player is scenery, not fixed in place.   
The don't mention undescribed items in room descriptions rule is not listed in any rulebook. [slight performance improvement]



Chapter 2 - Initial Belongings

The player is in the info desk.

The player carries the items list for the scavenger hunt.  The items list for the Scavenger Hunt is a thing. The description is "A newspaper[line break]A feather[line break]A flag[line break]A star[line break]A dinosaur[line break]A hat[line break]Something that was once alive".  The printed name of the items list for the Scavenger Hunt is "[if we have not examined the item described]unread [end if]list of items for the Scavenger Hunt".  Understand "item", "of items" as the items list for the Scavenger Hunt.

Carry out examining the list for the scavenger hunt: now the current goals is the list of scavenger hunt goals.

Last carry out taking inventory when we have examined the items list for the scavenger hunt: list the player's goals.

After printing the name of something lit while taking inventory, say ", providing light".

The player carries some dollars. The indefinite article of the dollars is "a few".  Understand "few", "dollar", "note", "money", "cash", "greenbacks", "buck", "bucks" as the dollars. 


Part 3 - Introduction

The time of day is 7:05 PM.

When play begins:
	say "It's your second year at the LEAP summer camp, and so far it's been as great as you remember last year to have been.  Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls 'your girlfriends', much to your embarrassment) are here again.  You spent yesterday catching up on the news in between options and classes, and now you're settling in with the smug sensation of not being a raw newbie any more.[paragraph break]The LEAP summer camp isn't quite the same as most summer camps.  LEAP is an acronym for 'Learning Enrichment Activity Program'; the brainchild of world-renowned educator Professor Damon Rose, it is housed on the campus of the University of Colorado at Valmont, and was created for Gifted and Talented Kids (gosh, that sounds impressive) to expand their horizons and encourage them to stretch their mental capabilities.[paragraph break]Whatever. That's all in the promotional flyers. You just know that you're in for two weeks of the sort of interesting classes you don't get in school, and a bunch of fun options with which to fill up the free time after classes.  This evening, for instance, you've signed up for a scavenger hunt....";
	ifndef debug;
	pause the game;  [this breaks the skein otherwise]
	enddef debug;
	say "LEAP, Day 2.  Evening.[paragraph break]'Okay, kids!' Michelle, the counselor in charge of the scavenger hunt option waves her hands to settle the crowd around you, before finally remembering her whistle.  A brief [i]fweep[r] sweeps through the room.  'Okay, does everyone have their list?  Everyone good?  Okay!  You have until 8:25 pm to find everything on your lists, return here, and show me your lists so I can check them.  So synchronize your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!'[paragraph break]Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.  Everyone except you: there's a sudden pressure in the back of your throat, and you feel dizzy ... it only lasts a moment, but by then everyone else is gone, leaving you alone."; 

Book 2 - Actions

Part 1 - tweaking the standard actions 

Chapter 1 - getting containers and supporters confused

First check inserting something into a supporter (called parent): if the parent is not [also] a container, try putting the noun on the second noun instead.

First check putting something on a container (called parent): if the parent is not [also] a supporter, try inserting the noun into the second noun instead.

[Understand the command "place" as "put".]  [in Extended Grammar by Aaron Reed]
Understand the command "peek" as "look".

Chapter 2 - pat yourself down

[this game uses FOCUS/SENSE/FEEL for its main dramatic action. But it's a transitive verb, so its only a matter of time until the typical kid types FEEL ME or TOUCH ME.  In that case, INVENTORY, as a sentence.]

First check touching yourself: say "You pat yourself down.  You have "; list the contents of the player, as a sentence, including contents; say "." instead.

Chapter 3 - looking and inventory out of world

[Understand the commands "kick" as "attack".]  [in Extended Grammar by Aaron Reed]
Understand "kung fu [something]", "karate chop/kick [something]", or "judo chop/kick [something]" as attacking.

Last check attacking when in chapter 9: say "You [one of]karate[or]judo[or]flying[purely at random] [one of]chop[or]kick[or]punch[purely at random] [the noun]." instead.
Last check attacking: say "You don't know kung fu!" instead.

The block attacking rule is not listed in the check attacking rules.

Understand the commands "slice", "prune", "cut" and "chop" as "attack".

Understand the commands "shoot" and "fire" as "attack".

Understand "aim" or "aim [text]" as a mistake ("[if in chapter 6]Thy mind cleareth...[otherwise]Your mind clears...")


Chapter 7 - fine means yes

Understand "i'm fine" or "fine" or "i am fine" as saying yes. [someone's "how are you" was rhetorical ]

Chapter 8 - singing

The block singing rule is not listed in any rulebook. 
Last check singing (this is the braying mule rule): say "[if Visiting Stacy-and-Ava has not happened]Your friend [end if]Ava's the singer, not you." instead.

[removed the condition to remove parser error on FOCUS commands -- it set up false expectations that the words are unknown by the game]

Understand "focus [direction]", "focus on [direction]", "concentrate on [direction]", "sense [direction]" as facing when the location is the Maelstrom.

Rule for supplying a missing noun when focusing on:
	if there is a salient emotional residue:
		now the noun is a random salient emotional residue;
	otherwise:
		now the noun is the location;

Check focusing on yourself: placeholder "Snark." instead.

Last check focusing on something which is a part of someone (called the target): try focusing on the target instead.

Last report focusing on an emotional residue: consider the focusing rules for the noun instead.

Last report focusing on:
	if the noun is the location and an emotional residue is salient: 
		consider the focusing rules for a random salient emotional residue instead.

Last report focusing on: say "You sense nothing untoward or out of the ordinary here." instead.

The focusing rules are an object-based rulebook.

Part 2 - Amplifying others' emotions

A toolbox emotion is a kind of value. The toolbox emotions are calm, anger, fear, curiosity, love. [As opposed to Contentment, as any writer will tell you that happy characters are boring characters.  :) ]

Understand "soothe/sooth/placid/calmness/normal" as calm.

[After reading a command when the player's command includes "muffle/dampen/decrease [calm]": say "Er, that could go in any number of directions. Try amplifying [list of every toolbox emotion except calm]."; reject the player's command.]

After reading a command when the player's command includes "muffle/dampen/decrease [toolbox emotion]", replace the matched text with "calm". [note: I implement Dampening any emotion as equivalent to Amplifying Calm ]

Amplifying it for is an action applying to one toolbox emotion and one visible thing.
Understand "[toolbox emotion]", "[toolbox emotion] [someone]", or "amplify [toolbox emotion]" or "amplify [toolbox emotion] for/to/with/by/into/in/from/on/within/onto [someone]" as amplifying it for. 
Understand "[someone] [toolbox emotion]", "amplify [someone] [toolbox emotion]" or "make [someone] [toolbox emotion]" as amplifying it for (with nouns reversed).

Last report folding: say "You ponder making an origami [noun]." instead.

Understand the command "unfold", "unfurl" as "open".

Last instead of opening something unopenable when we have folded the noun: say "You unfold [the noun]."; rule succeeds.

[The unlikely to mean removing unworn things rule is not listed in the does the player mean rulebook. ]  [throws error]


Part 10 - Inquiring someone About an object

To say (p - a person) quips (q - a quip): start conversation with p on q. [ Connects Inquiring It About to the Quip system.   The former system of using ASK Person ABOUT "Topic" was broken because, in the "conversation table of the Person", the topic column has to have the topics for all the objects in the game re-listed within it. This is error-prone, laborious, and destroys any parsing intelligence such as disambiguation, scope, does-the-player-mean fine tuning, etc.  So I've created an ASK Person ABOUT Object (Inquiring It About) which consults the "object-based conversation table of the Person" for objects, once Inform has run its full parsing AI on what the heck the player meant by "TAKE RED". The above Say phrase allows me to marry the ASK ABOUT Object system's parsing to the pre-existing Quip system's dialogue-threading. Win-win. ]

[For each character, use like the following.  Note that the default reply is the first row of the table. This allows it to be character-specific without writing additional rules or proxy objects. 
Replies with [if..] constructs may need a [run paragraph on] construct within them. (It's either putting RPO in half of them, or putting [line break] in the other half of them.) 
The column "conversation" is named specifically because the topic conversation table uses "conversation" as an object column too.  This makes certain coding tricks easier... such as combining the two tables into a single one of 3 columns. ]

[
The object-based conversation table of Mr So-and-so is the table of so-and-so's replies.

Table of so-and-so's replies
conversation 			reply
an object				"The first row is the default i-don't-know response.[line break]"
his red right hand			"A great song."
one red shoe				"A great movie."
]

A person has a table-name called the object-based conversation table. 

Understand "ask [someone] about [any thing]" or "ask about/-- [any thing]" or "a about/-- [any thing]" as inquiring it about. Inquiring it about is an action applying to one thing and one visible thing. Does the player mean inquiring someone about something (called the subject) (this is the assume conversation about present things rule): if the subject is in the location, it is very likely[; otherwise say "Not applicable."].  Does the player mean inquiring someone about something (called the subject) (this is the assume non-conversation about off-stage things rule): if the subject is off-stage, it is unlikely[; otherwise say "Not applicable."].  Rule for supplying a missing noun when inquiring something about something (this is the assume conversation with the only person here rule): if the number of people in the location who are not the player is 1, now the noun is a random person in the location who is not the player.
	
Report inquiring something about a conversation listed in (the object-based conversation table of the noun) (this is the chooses response per object rule): say "[the reply entry][line break]" instead.

Carry out inquiring something about an achieved goal (this is the blank-out goals from conv tables rule):
	if the second noun is a conversation listed in (the object-based conversation table of the noun):
		choose row with a conversation of the second noun in (the object-based conversation table of the noun);
		blank out the whole row.

Last report inquiring it about when (the object-based conversation table of the noun) is not the default value of table name (this is the chooses default response per unknown object rule): 
	choose row 1 in the object-based conversation table of the noun;
	say "[the reply entry][line break]" instead.

Last report inquiring it about when (the object-based conversation table of the noun) is the default value of table name (this is the inquire action has no idea rule): 
	try talking to the noun instead.

Check asking someone about "themself/theirself/himself/herself": try inquiring the noun about the noun instead.

[Persuasion rule for asking someone (called the owner) to try giving something (called the owned) to the player (this is the convert failed asking-for to inquiring-about rule):
	try inquiring the owner about the owned instead.]

Understand "hi [someone]" or "hello [someone]" or "greet [someone]" as talking to. 
Understand "hi" or "hello" as talking to. 

Understand "thanks" or "thank you" as a mistake ("'You're welcome.'").

[TODO:   when i DOES THE PLAYER MEAN, if there is more than one final option with equal rank, *everything* is written. ]


Part 12 - going and EXITS

[The action is in the Textfyre Standard Rules, but as a novice player myself, EXITS is much more useful as a response to Going Nowhere than the standard response... or even as an explicit EXITS command itself.  --Ron]

Check going nowhere: 
	ignore the advance time rule;
	try listing exits instead. 

After printing the name of a direction (called the way) while listing exits:
	if the room way from the location is visited, say " (to [the room way from the location])".

The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall."

A never-ending supply of LEAP flyers are stacked in a corner.  Tucked away into a corner is a small saucer for loose change.  (The receptionist usually keeps this in a corner of the desk where only she can see it, but apparently it's been moved.  She's only here during the school year, anyway.)"

A saucer is scenery on the information desk. "[if the loose change has not been handled]Sitting in the saucer are a few random coins.  Funny, wasn't this dish empty when you passed by the desk this morning?[otherwise if nothing is in the saucer]Someone appears to have swiped all the loose change![otherwise if the newspaper has been handled][one of]Someone appears to have swiped -- hang on, t[or]T[stopping]he saucer's got a bunch of coins in it again.[otherwise if the loose change has been handled]Sitting in the saucer are a few oddly familiar coins."

Part 3 - lobby east

Chapter 1 - Description

The first floor lobby east is a room, east of first floor lobby west, southeast of info desk. "This used to be a rather large dining room, once upon a time, and it still has a low-hanging chandelier right in the middle of the ceiling.  A piano's been pushed under the chandelier so that nobody accidentally gets a head full of crystal walking blindly around, and the place is generally used as a kind of music room now.  The info desk is back to the northwest, and to the west is the rest of the first floor lobby.  Wide picture windows look out on the front lawn and on the southern part of Calvin Field[if in Chapter 1]. The School of Rock option is in progress here, jamming away in the upper decibels[otherwise if in chapter 2]. A group of older kids seem to be discussing the psychology of cats in one corner[end if]."


Chapter 2 - Scenery

A low-hanging chandelier is scenery, in first floor lobby east. "Pretty, but mostly useless.  You suspect that it's more glass than crystal these days, too: you distinctly remember someone (who certainly wasn't you, no sir!) knocking out part of it with an enthusiastic trombone slide last year, but this year there appears to be no sign of the damage."

A baby grand piano is scenery, in the first floor lobby east. "Ava says it's a baby grand, and she knows more about this sort of thing.  All grand pianos seem more or less alike to you.  The pile of plastic dinosaurs under the piano probably makes it unique, however."

Carry out playing the baby grand piano when in chapter 2:
	if Ava is not in the location, say "You bang out a few bars of 'Lean On Me' before hitting a wrong note (it doesn't take long) and stopping.  The only reason you learned that tune was to annoy Ava, anyway: she hates that song.";
	otherwise say "You bang out a few bars of 'Lean On Me' before Ava stops you.  She really has no love for that particular song at all."[;
	rule succeeds.]

Check looking under the baby grand piano: say "Under the piano is a pile of plastic dinosaurs, left there for no other reason than that people are less likely to step on a plastic dinosaur when it's under a piano." instead.

At the rooftop parapet, you can also make out a bunch of happy campers dropping things off the edge.  That must be the Egg Drop option, if you remember rightly.[otherwise]The old part of Jacobs Hall used to be a millionaire's mansion, way back in ancient history.  It's all red sandstone and gargoyles and fancy stonework.  Then it got donated to the university and the first thing they did was to slap a huge, square-ish brick nonentity onto the north side; of course, the new part is where all the real business of Jacobs Hall gets done: the fancy, red sandstone mansion part is just where parents and newbies and visitors meet with the staff."  Jacobs Hall is in second avenue, calvin field north, calvin field south, the courtyard, and the front lawn.

[[The Jacobs Hall backdrop is a privately-named backdrop. The The Jacobs Hall backdrop is everywhere.] The printed name of the The Jacobs Hall is "Jacobs Hall".]

Calvin Field South is an exterior room. "During the school year, this part of Calvin Field gets pretty scuffed up by students playing football or whatever inter-department sports tickle their fancy at the time.

He's wearing a set of pajamas with teddy bears printed on them, but you really don't have time right now to wonder how a cool dude like Brad could wear pajamas with teddy bears printed on them.

Part 6 - Calvin Field North

Chapter 1 - Description

Calvin Field north is an exterior room, north of Calvin Field South, east of info desk. "Claremont Hall, to the north, looms over the entire length of Calvin Field, which continues to the south.  Jacobs Hall is back to the west, and the dining hall is to the east.  A fountain takes up space right where all the paths meet, so there usually aren't that many people running around and tearing up the grass.  Right now, though, there are several people running around, playing Myth Tag, and there's nothing the fountain can do about it."

Chapter 2 - Scenery

The Myth Tag option is an option, scenery, in Calvin Field North. "It's sort of like normal tag, except you can declare yourself 'safe' by crouching down and naming a mythological creature.  No repeats, though: one of the counselors is keeping track of what's been named so far."

The view of Claremont Hall is a university building, in Calvin Field North. "Claremont Hall looks very grand, standing on a rise at the north end of Calvin Field.  It's a red sandstone building with rounded arches and red shingles, and a huge clock tower right over the door."  The view of Claremont Hall is in Calvin Field south, the rooftop, the courtyard. 

A huge clock tower is scenery, part of the view of Claremont Hall. "The Claremont Hall clock tower has never told the right time, not since it was built.  Someone told you last year that it's haunted, but that's the sort of thing people always tell kids on their first summer at camp."

A fountain is scenery, in Calvin Field North. "The fountain consists of a wide, shallow basin and a modern sculpture that, to you, looks a lot like Big Foot taking a shower.  It's not running right now."

Carry out searching the fountain when the player does not have a feather: say "You spot a lone feather just lying there, presumably lost from some passing pigeon.  You grab it before the wind blows it away."; now the player carries the feather. 


Part 7 - Front Lawn

Chapter 1 - Description

The Front Lawn is an exterior room, west of Calvin Field South, southeast of Second Avenue. "A whole bunch of walls have been temporarily erected all over the front lawn for the Graffiti Art option.  The smell of paint is everywhere, not to mention the hiss of spray cans.  Passersby on Second Avenue -- to the northwest -- will no doubt find this all very interesting.  A flagpole rises up from the maze of makeshift walls here, while Calvin Field and the more athletic options are off to the east." The front lawn is in the campus grounds. 

Chapter 2 - Scenery

The graffiti option is an option, scenery, in Front Lawn. "Some of it is actually pretty good.  But is it Art?"

Some cans of spray paint are scenery, in Front Lawn. "A multitude of different colors, all of it in the hands of kids with instructions to just 'go wild'.  The bathrooms are going to be pretty jammed up this evening."

A flagpole is scenery in the front lawn. "[if the star-spangled banner is scenery]It's keeping the good ol['] Star-spangled Banner well out of the reach of the spraypaint-happy campers all around you.[otherwise if the star-spangled banner is fixed in place]The flag is at the bottom of the flagpole.[otherwise]The flagpole seems to be missing a flag.  Huh."

The Star-Spangled Banner is [initially] fixed in place scenery in the front lawn. "[if the star-spangled banner is scenery]It's not exactly the dawn's early light, but you can see it quite clearly, drifting in the wind high overhead.[otherwise if the star-spangled banner is fixed in place]Up close, you realize it's bigger than you are!  How will you carry it?[otherwise]The camp's flag has seen some years of use.  It looks older than the camp itself." Understand "flag", "american", "american flag", "great/big/huge/ginormous", or "old glory" as the Star-Spangled Banner. The printed name of the banner is "[if taking inventory]enormous American flag (folded into a triangle)[otherwise]Star-Spangled Banner".

[the banner:  
"scenery" means it is up high
"fixed in place" means it is unfolded ]

Check climbing the flagpole: say "You're not that good an athlete." instead.
First check folding the flagpole: now the noun is the star-spangled banner. [no instead -- typecast]

[turning off the "scenery" bit]
Instead of doing something except examining or turning with the Star-Spangled Banner when the star-spangled banner is scenery, say "It's way too high to reach."

Understand "lower [Star-Spangled Banner]" or "raise [Star-Spangled Banner]" or "lower [flagpole]" or "raise [flagpole]" as turning.  Check turning the Banner: try turning the flagpole instead. [saves me creating a one-off Lower action]  

Check turning the flagpole when the Star-Spangled Banner is not enclosed by the location: say "There's little point without the Stars and Stripes to put up there." instead.

Check turning the flagpole when the Star-Spangled Banner is scenery: say "You unwind the pulley rope, and lower the flag.  The great flag now within reach."; now the Star-Spangled Banner is not scenery; rule succeeds.  

Check turning the flagpole when the Star-Spangled Banner is not scenery and the star-spangled banner is enclosed by the location: say "Perhaps some things are more important than a scavenger hunt.  You raise the Star-spangled Banner to its rightful place."; now the Star-Spangled Banner is fixed in place scenery in the front Lawn; rule succeeds.

[the fixed in place bit]
Instead of doing something except examining, touching, folding, or turning with the Star-Spangled Banner when the star-spangled banner is fixed in place not scenery, say "It's way too big to carry when unfurled."

Carry out folding the Star-Spangled Banner: now the player carries the banner; now the banner is not fixed in place.

Report folding the Star-Spangled Banner: now the time of day is the time of day plus 3 minutes; say "It takes some time, but you get the whole flag into its traditional triangular shape." instead.

Check dropping the Star-Spangled Banner: say "The flag must never touch the ground." instead.

The Star-Spangled Banner fulfills the flag-goal.

Part 8 - Courtyard

Chapter 1 - Description

The courtyard is an exterior room, northeast of Second Avenue, northwest of Calvin Field north. "The courtyard is a hard, concrete square ringed by bushes and trees.  It's not terribly interesting, but Aidan sometimes comes here to play basketball with his friends, as if the camp counselors didn't make you all run around enough already.  The other university buildings are visIble beyond the treetops, and the blank north face of Jacobs Hall rises up to the south; paths southeast and southwest lead around Jacobs Hall, though there is no entrance to the building from here.".  The courtyard is in the campus grounds. 


Chapter 2 - Scenery

	now the player carries the blades of grass instead.

Some distant university buildings are scenery, in the Courtyard. "Jacobs Hall is to the south, and Claremont Hall is to the east.  Neither of them can be entered directly from here.  Over the treetops to the north, you can also make out the Ridgeway Museum and the university library."

The view of Claremont Hall is in the Courtyard.
Ridgeway Museum is a university building. "The university buildings aren't of much interest, at least not from here."
The University Library is a university building. "The university buildings aren't of much interest, at least not from here."

Check searching the eggboxes:
	if the player does not have a feather:
		say "Poking about the debris, you come across one that is stuffed full of blue feathers.  Guessing that the actual number of feathers is probably not part of the scientific data under examination, you help yourself to one.";
		now the player carries the feather;
	otherwise:
		say "Poking about the debris, you find nothing on your list that you did not already have.";
	rule succeeds.

Instead of doing something except searching when the scattered eggboxes are physically involved, say "Don't interfere with someone else's scientific data."

Looks like they've decided to take the unoffered 'Hide and Seek' option.  You're about to yell at them to settle down when the world suddenly turns mauve.  It only lasts a split-second, but leaves you feeling a little dizzy and disoriented.";
	if the time since Scavenger Hunting began is 15 minutes and true is has yet to encounter a single weird emotional thing, say "You feel an odd, ticklish sensation on the tip of your nose as two of the older campers walk past, and then your head begins to hurt.

Part 21 - your room

Chapter 1 - Description

your room is a dorm room. "You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooler.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north."  Understand "my" or "your" or "dorm" as your room.

your door is a closed [not dorm door, for ease of coding ] door, scenery, south of pits east, north of your room. Understand "my" or "your" as your door.

	if the room gone to is in the Claremont Hall region, say "Claremont Hall is off-limits.  It's only full of empty lecture halls, anyway." instead;
	if the room gone to is the dining hall, say "The Dining Hall is off-limits for the moment.  And anyway, you don't really want to go in there: you might actually see what they do to the food to make it taste so awful, and then you'll have nightmares for weeks." instead.

First check going to an exterior room when in chapter 2: say "It's against the rules to leave the building during dorm time." instead.

First carry out going north when in your room and in chapters 1 through 7: say "You step out of the room, locking it behind you." [no instead here -- just narrate ]

Chapter 2 - Scenery

Instead of doing something when in your room and the cutout werewolf is involved:

A cutout vampire is scenery, in your room. "It is a mystery to you why anyone would think these snotty, bloodless monsters are cool, except in the sense of being cold, dead bodies.  Also, this particular vampire cutout seems to have a disconcerting way of following you with his eyes, which is really creepy."

Your bed is scenery, a supporter, in your room. "A standard, regulation LEAP bed, with nothing under it but dust.  You've looked several times, especially in the mornings when you can't find your [one of]slippers[or]socks[or]shoes[or]keys[at random]."

Check looking under your bed: 
	say "Oh hey, someone's gone and swept under the bed[if a LEAP camp flyer is off-stage].  And it seems Jeremy left a camp flyer under here[end if].";
	if a LEAP camp flyer is off-stage, move the LEAP camp flyer to the location;
	rule succeeds.

Check hiding yourself under your bed when in chapter 8: say "Aidan may be pumped full of sedatives, but they're not going to make him stupid enough to miss you crawling under your bed!" instead.

The actual outlet is probably in some inconvenient place behind the desk, but why they couldn't just supply you with a power bar, you don't know.  Well, you suppose desks with built-in outlets are pretty cool.  Just... not as cool as werewolves."

Understand "standard", "regulation", "LEAP", "laptop" as your desk when your desk is in the location.

The built-in electrical outlet is part of your desk. Understand "electric", "power", "socket" as the built-in electrical outlet.

"The large window at this end of the corridor would normally look out over Second Avenue, but someone's gone and plastered it over with cutouts of every actor who's ever played James Bond.

The way back to the east looks significantly less cloak-and-dagger."

The rap session option is an option, scenery, in the third floor lobby. "Rap or beat poetry, there's not that much difference that you can see here.  People are basically talking about their lives in an improvised rhythmic fashion."

Check taking the rap session option:
	say "Maybe after your improv theatre class." instead.

Check listening when the rap session option is in the location: say "The girl holding center stage right now is good.  Very good.  But the more you listen, the more your head hurts, and you're finally forced to take a few steps away from the group." instead.


Chapter 3 - Event on Entering

Last report going when the rap session option is in the location during Scavenger Hunting: fire TRIG_RAPSESSION.

TRIG_RAPSESSION is a trigger.

Rule for firing unfired TRIG_RAPSESSION:
	now has yet to encounter a single weird emotional thing is false;
	say "As you enter the area, you experience a momentary headache and the urge to sneeze.  The feeling disappears quickly, but evidently not quickly enough because Aidan clearly seems to have noticed something wrong.  He breaks away from the rest of his option and comes up to you. [paragraph break]";
	move Aidan to the Location;
	start conversation with Aidan on Q_AIDAN_0.

Rule for firing fired TRIG_RAPSESSION:
	say "There it is, that funny throbbing feeling in the back of your head.  And there, it's gone again.";

Chapter 4 - Aidan

Section 1 - description of Aidan

Aidan is a man.  "[if in chapter 1]Your brother Aidan is here, having signed up for the Rap Session option.[otherwise if in chapter 2 and the player is in Aidan's room]Aidan is sitting at his desk, clearly in the middle of a computer game of some sort.[otherwise if in chapter 2]Your brother Aidan is here.[otherwise if in chapter 6]Robin Hood, thy brother-in-arms, standeth before thee.[otherwise if in chapter 7]Aidan's here, and he looks seriously psychotic![otherwise if in chapter 8]Aidan is here, swaying a little and looking like an enraged bull with a killer headache.[otherwise if  in chapter 9 and the player is in the deepest place]Aidan's here, and he looks normal.  Except he knows kung fu, which isn't quite normal.[otherwise if in chapter 10]Aidan's sitting with a small handful of his closest friends, off at the other side of the hall.  They seem rather subdued; most of the other campers seem to be keeping their distance." [otherwise, do nothing -- is scenery ]  
The description of Aidan is "[if Here Comes The Flood is happening]He's sitting with a crowd of older campers, at the other side of the hall.  You're not so insecure that you absolutely have to sit beside him at every meal.  Not now that you're a mature second-year camper, anyway[otherwise if in chapters 1 through 5]Aidan is your big brother.  He looks quite a lot like you, only taller and broader.  He's pretty cool; he just turned 15 a couple of months ago, but hasn't gotten too cool to be seen with you yet.  On the other hand, if your secret plot to grow up just like him works out, he'll never get too cool for you[otherwise if in chapter 6]Robin Hood is thy brother in arms -- and indeed, thy brother Aidan.  There is not a nobler fellow in all of merry old England[otherwise if in chapter 7][PLACEHOLDER]TODO: examining is much like the Focusing action[end placeholder][otherwise if in chapter 9 and in the deepest place]Aidan is your big brother.  He looks quite a lot like you, only taller and broader.  He also seems to know kung fu, though that isn't really giving him much of an edge over the Thief[otherwise if in chapter 10]Aidan is your big brother.  He looks quite a lot like you, only taller and broader.  He's pretty cool when he isn't a raving murderous monster, which Dr Rose says is never going to happen again.  For now, he just looks grateful that anyone at all is willing to still be friends with him after everything that's happened in the past week[end if]."  

Check examining Aidan when in chapter 8: say "Aidan looks a bit drugged out, but no less dangerous.  [if Aidan has been able to see Brad]His hands are clenched into fists, and he seems intent on pounding you into applesauce[otherwise]His right hand is clenched in a fist around his room keys, which he seems intent on sending to the back of your skull[end if]." instead.

Check examining Aidan when in chapter 9 and the player is in land of the dead: say "[if old-Aidan does not wear a ring] He looks grey and cold and lifeless.  His hands are crossed at the wrist, over his chest, fingers splayed.  For some reason, he's dressed up as Robin Hood[otherwise if old-Aidan wears two rings]He looks feverish, like he's in pain.  He's wearing a pair of matching rings[otherwise]He looks like he's asleep.  His hands are crossed at the wrist, over his chest, fingers splayed.  For some reason, he's dressed up as Robin Hood.  A single gold ring glints on one finger[end if]." instead.

Check examining Aidan when in chapter 9 and the player is not in the mindscape: say "He doesn't look very happy to be here.  Then again, who would?  Fortunately for everyone, he's also unconscious and drooling slightly.  He's being kept sedated, but goodness only knows how long that will last."[; try Focusing on Aidan ?] [todo?] instead.


Understand "big bro/brother", "bro/brother", "my bro/brother", "my big bro/brother", "taller", "broader", "aiden" as Aidan.


section 2 - conversation with Aidan

Instead of conversing when in chapters 7 through 8 and Aidan is the noun, say "Aidan does not appear to be in any mood to listen to you.  He probably can't even hear you over the pounding blood in his ears."

Instead of conversing when in chapter 3 and Aidan is the noun, say "Aidan's too far away to speak to, at the moment.  You'll have to wait until later this evening."  

Instead of conversing when in chapter 5 and Aidan is the noun, say "Aidan's too far away to speak to, at the moment.  You'll have to wait until later this evening."

[Instead of conversing when Aidan is the noun and in chapter 6, say "Forsooth, such existeth not within the bounds of this simulation."]

The object-based conversation table of Aidan is the table of Aidan's replies.

Table of Aidan's replies

A woman can be asked about.  A woman is usually not asked about.

To say Aidan on Ava & Stacy: 
	now the second noun is asked about;
	if in chapter 1:
		say "'Oh yeah, she's your girlfriend, isn't she?'[paragraph break]'She is not!'[paragraph break]'Sure she isn't.' Aidan grins in a way that makes you want to smack him. [if Ava is asked about and Stacy is asked about] 'You're going to have to choose between one of those two girls one of these days, you know.'[end if][paragraph break]'She is NOT my girlfriend!'";
	otherwise if in chapter 6: 
		say "And who, pray tell, is this maiden of whom thou asketh?  She appeareth not in the script.";
	otherwise if in chapter 2: 
		say "It wouldn't be polite to talk about her[if the second noun is in the location] while she's standing right there[end if].  Anyway, Aidan's probably going to give you the ribbing of your life later about how all the girls just fawn over you, bleagh."


To say about Joe and Hank and bullying: say "[if in Chapter 1]'Look, if anyone starts picking on you, you be sure to tell me, okay?'[otherwise if in Chapter 2 and Crystal Quest has not happened]'Sorry, Daniel.  I mean, I could just tell them to stop picking on people, but that's never worked before.  Unless there's something else you need from them, we're out of luck.'[otherwise if in chapter 2 and Crystal Quest is happening][Aidan quips CT_AIDAN_HELP][otherwise if in Chapter 6]Such craven villains existeth not in the time of Robin Hood; or if they did, thou shalt surely vanquish them ere the tale is told."

Report asking Aidan about "[damon]" when in chapters 1 through 2: say "Yeah, he was a pretty cool dude.  You remember, you met him last year.  I was kind of worried about how things were going to be this year, now he's gone and his sister's in charge, but so far it's been okay, I think." instead.
Report asking Aidan about "[bullying]" when in chapters 1 through 2: say "[about Joe and Hank and bullying]" instead.

Section 3 - actions on Aidan

Check attacking Aidan when in Chapter 9 and the player is not in the mindscape: say "No way.  Somewhere inside that monster is the brother who helped you with the bullies and who carried you all the way to the hospital himself when you collapsed.  Right now, he needs your help more than anything." instead.

Check attacking Aidan when in chapter 9 and the player is in mindscape: say "Aidan certainly isn't expecting that, but he's quick enough to dodge your attack.  You've distracted him just enough, however."; Go straight to section "You Fail To Give Aidan The Sword" in Chapter 09 text; rule fails.

Check attacking Aidan: say "[if in chapters 1 through 5]No way, Mom would kill you.  After she's done killing Aidan for killing you, because, let's face it, Aidan could probably break you in two with both hands tied behind his back.[otherwise if in chapter 6]Nay, [']twould get thee kicked from the simulation.[otherwise if in chapters 7 through 8]Are you out of your mind?" instead.

Check kissing Aidan: say "[if in chapters 1 through 5]You're a little too old for that sort of soppiness, don't you think?[otherwise if in chapter 6]Thou art past the age for such sop, dost thou not think?[otherwise if in chapters 7 through 8] That's not going to change his mind![otherwise if in chapter 9]Sadly, you lack the magical Mom power of kissing away owies." instead.

Check pushing Aidan: say "[if in chapters 1 through 2]You nudge Aidan with your elbow.  He nudges you back without thinking.[otherwise if in chapters 3 through 5]He's too far away, and probably wouldn't appreciate it anyway.[otherwise if in chapter 6]The script doth proceed apace without recourse to aught additional effort on thy part.[otherwise if in chapter 7 through 8]Are you out of your mind?[otherwise if in chapter 9]Aidan isn't going anywhere without your help, and this isn't helping." instead.
	
Check pulling [or moving] Aidan while in chapters 1 through 2: say "Aidan's quite capable of moving on his own, thank you very much." instead.

'Hey, didn't we stop playing those staring games years and years ago?'[otherwise if in chapter 2 through 3]You think you can hear someone playing an oboe.  Somewhere.[otherwise if in chapter 5]Aidan seems a little more irritable than usual.  You're not sure what it is, but there's something new and dangerous about him, lurking just under the surface.[otherwise if in chapter 6]Thy brother is in a temper, and thou shouldst tread carefully about him." instead.

Check focusing on Aidan when in chapter 7 for the first time: say "You sense rage and anger and frustration and hatred and more rage, so much so that you almost feel the same emotions yourself.  Just when you think you're going to fall into the same emotional whirlpool as Aidan has, you become aware that Aidan has paused in his assault on Lucian, and instead is swaying a little, a confused look on his face.  As you register this, Aidan shakes his head and returns his attention to Lucian.

Check focusing on Aidan when in chapter 7 [for the second time]: say "Rage and anger and hatred and rage and nothing else and suddenly you find yourself somewhere else entirely...."; now the weather is cloudy skies; now nobody follows the player; move the player to the battlefield; rule succeeds.

He's like a walking explosion of anger and aggression and more anger and it's every bit as scary as the fact that he's trying to kill you![otherwise]So much anger!  But ... there, underneath it all, is that a hint of that brotherly love and concern that made him carry you all the way to the hospital last week?[end if]  [line break]" instead.

Check focusing on Aidan when in chapter 9 and the player is NOT in the mindscape and the player has been [expelled from]in the living room: say "You take a deep breath and focus again on your brother's emotions.

Check focusing on Aidan when in chapter 9 and the player is NOT in the mindscape: say "[one of]You can sense raw, directionless rage and aggression, mixed with a large dose of confusion, all of it fortunately damped down by the sedatives.  Now that you're aware of it, it becomes rather hard to ignore.  Dr Rose, watching you intently, encourages you to go on.  'You can do it, Daniel.  I know you can.'[or]It's just like the last time, only the aggressive emotions seem much more muted.  There is confusion and fear as well.  As you focus, Aidan's emotions become the only ones you are aware of, and then you're somewhere else...[go to living room][stopping]"; rule succeeds.

The third floor rooms west is a room, west of the third floor lobby, up from the second floor rooms west. "In defiance of the prescribed decoration scheme, someone has stuck a large poster of one of Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' paintings on the wall here.  The scattering of constellations around seem small and weak by comparison.  There is also the window overlooking Second Avenue, surrounded by a thicket of stars; meanwhile, the fire stairs only go down from here, and the corridor continues back to the east."

Chapter 2 - Scenery


The poster of Vincent Van Gogh's painting Starry Night is scenery, in the third floor rooms west. "It's very much an artistic interpretation of the subject; generally, the cutouts provided here tend to take more of a scientific, or at least science-fictional, approach."

Part 28 - third floor rooms east

Chapter 1 - Description

The third floor rooms east is a room, east of the third floor lobby, up from the second floor rooms east. "This end of the corridor looks like the inside of a space shuttle.  Someone's gone to great care to create window-like frames for the stars and planets and whatnot; even the window overlooking Calvin Field has been made to look like a space shuttle viewport.  Outer Space is back to the west; presumably the planet Earth is down the stairs."

Chapter 2 - Scenery

Some window-like frames are scenery, in the third floor rooms east. "You have to wonder what the Powers That Be think of people actually applying paint to the walls.  I mean, there's a reason they provided cutouts to paste onto the walls, and that you can take off again.  Then again, well, there's no way anyone could have done all this in the short time you've been here, so quite probably it was done by the college kids during the semester and the Powers That Be decided to just go with the theme rather than call in the graffiti removal squad."

Understand "space", "shuttle", "stars", "planets", "viewport", "paint", "painted", "graffiti" as the window-like frames.

The constellation of Orion is scenery, in the third floor rooms east. "The mighty hunter... he's the only constellation you can recognize in the night sky."  Understand "mighty", "hunter", "star", "Orion's belt", "belt", "Betelgeuse", "Rigel" as the constellation of Orion.

The courtyard downstairs is way more pleasant.[if in chapter 1][paragraph break]The Eggdrop option is busy tossing boxes of eggs over the parapet: a table has been set up as well, and is covered with artsy-craftsy materials with which a number of campers are building egg-preservation containers.[end if]".

A large bottle of white Elmer's glue is scenery, on the eggdrop option table. "There is a large bottle of white glue here, available for, and constantly in, use."  Check taking the glue: say "You can use some glue while you're here, but there's no need in taking a whole bottle." instead.

A feather is a thing. The description is "You have a feather.  It's a rather strange shade of blue that probably doesn't exist in nature."

The boa is represented by the feather. 
The boa vends the feather.
The feather fulfills the feather-goal.

Check taking the boa when the feather is handled:
	say "You only need one feather.  No sense in taking another one, unless you plan on taking the option." instead.

Report taking the boa: say "You pluck a feather from one of the boas.  No-one notices or cares." instead.

Section 6 - Eggdrop Option

The eggdrop-option is an option, scenery, privately-named, in rooftop. "The idea is to build a container that will enable an egg to survive a three-story drop onto the concrete below.  Everybody seems to be very deeply involved in the project."

Understand "class", "eggdrop", "egg drop", "egg-drop", "option", "options" as the eggdrop-option.
Understand  "people", "campers" as the eggdrop-option when the eggdrop-option is in the location.

Chapter 3 - Event on Entering

Last report going to rooftop during Scavenger Hunting: fire TRIG_EGGDROP.

TRIG_EGGDROP is a trigger.

Rule for firing unfired TRIG_EGGDROP:
	say "As you emerge into the sunlight, you feel a momentary dizziness that makes you almost want to hurl.  The feeling is gone very quickly, but your heart is left pumping as though you'd just run a couple of miles.";

Rule for firing fired TRIG_EGGDROP:
	say "There's that dizzy feeling again; this time you're ready for it.  As it fades away, you almost swear you taste something vaguely sour in the air.";


Book 5 - Claremont building

Part 1 - air vents

An air vent is a kind of container. An air vent is scenery, fixed in place, transparent.  The printed name of an air vent is usually "air vent". An air vent is usually closed, not openable[, locked, not lockable]. Rule for clarifying the parser's choice of an air vent: do nothing.

A vent grill is a kind of thing. "[if the grill is part of something closed]It covers the air vent and is securely screwed into the wall.[otherwise]The vent's grill is missing."  A vent grill is usually scenery. A vent grill is part of every air vent. 

Check entering an air vent (called the spot): say "[if the spot is closed]The vent is covered over with a metal grill, to prevent silly people like you from getting lost in an HVAC maze of twisty little ducts, all alike.  You couldn't turn around in there, anyway, and the idea of crawling backwards through such a tight squeeze, in darkness, makes you want to hurl.[otherwise]The duct beyond might be wide enough to crawl through, though not to turn around, but the vent itself is too small for you to fit through now.  Maybe you shouldn't have had that growth spurt after all." instead.

Understand "remove [something] with/using [something]" as unlocking it with.
Understand "unscrew [something] with/using [something]" as unlocking it with.

First check opening an air vent: if the player has the screwdriver, now the noun is openable.

Check taking a vent grill: try opening the holder of the noun instead.
Check opening a vent grill: try opening the holder of the noun instead. 
Check turning a vent grill: try opening the holder of the noun instead.
Check unlocking a vent grill with: try unlocking the holder of the noun with the second noun instead.

Check unlocking an air vent with something which is not the screwdriver: say "[The second noun] won't work the screws loose." instead.
Check unlocking an air vent with the screwdriver: try opening the noun instead.

Check turning an air vent: try opening the noun instead.
Check taking an air vent: try opening the noun instead.
Check opening an air vent when the player does not have the screwdriver: say "You're not strong enough to tear this thing from the wall with your bare hands." instead.

[Carry out opening an air vent: now the noun is open. [now the grill is not part of the air vent;][ remove the obstacle from play.]]
Report opening an air vent: say "You remove the screws as quickly as you can, the head of the screwdriver slipping from the screws rather more often than is usual.  Eventually, the grill falls off and is immediately lost among the boxes of costume accessories." instead.

[First check examining an open air vent: ignore the examine containers rule. [prevents annoying "The air vent is empty" message]]

Check shouting at an air vent: say "Your own hollow voice echoes back at you." instead.
Check shouting at an air vent for three turns: say "A hollow voice says, 'Fool!'" instead.


Part 2 - descriptions and scenery

The auditorium is a room. "The chairs of the auditorium have been folded up and moved aside, to give everyone plenty of room to spread out in the middle and even on the stage.  A rather harsh, bright light illuminates the central portion of the room and leaves the corners in shadows; the overall effect is to produce that still, dead, rather muffled feel that most theaters seem to have when they're not in use.  The backstage areas are to the north, and the main exit is to the west."  The auditorium is visited.

Some light is scenery in the auditorium. "You can see dust motes floating in the air."

The stage is scenery in the auditorium. "It is a low platform, without curtains, occupying the north side of the room.  The backstage areas are behind it."

The chairs are scenery in the auditorium. "They have been folded up and set aside, and are of no concern to you.  At least, not until you want to fill them with audience members."

Backstage is north of the auditorium. "Backstage is cramped, cluttered and chaotic, and it's not even in use yet.  It also smells of old costumes, which is hardly surprising, given the racks of costumes mouldering in one airless cubbyhole.  The stage and the auditorium are to the south, and a door out into the hallway is to the west." Backstage is visited. 

Some costumes are scenery in backstage. [The description is] "A brief rummage through the costumes reveals nothing but dust, more costumes, an air vent, and an overwhelming urge to sneeze."

The backstage air vent is an air vent in backstage. [The description is] "The air vent is almost hidden behind the racks of costumes[if the backstage air vent is open].  The protective grill has been removed and lost among the costumes[end if]." 

Understand "sneeze" as  a mistake ("[italic type]Achoo![roman type][if Ava is in the Backstage][paragraph break]'These things sure are dusty,' says Ava, rubbing her nose.  'And that air vent's no help.'"). 

The film studio north is a room. "The film studio has been deserted, and in a hurry, too.  Notebooks and papers and pens have been dropped or left behind, and chairs have been overturned.  It is quiet, the only sounds being the hum of warm air being pushed into the room through the vent high up in the wall.  [if in the film studio north]The studio continues off to the south, and the exit to the hallway is to the west.[otherwise]It seems safe to enter.[end if]"

Some debris is scenery in the film studio north.  "People have sure left in a hurry.  You can taste the shock and fear clinging to the debris they've left behind."  Understand "chairs", "notebooks", "papers", "pens" as some debris when in the film studio north. 


The film studio air vent is an open air vent in the film studio north. [The description is] "This particular vent doesn't have a grill, and the rows of shelving beneath it make it fairly accessible.  The wall around it looks as if it's been attacked with a sledgehammer.  Unfortunately for whoever attacked it, the dents in the metal duct have only served to make the opening more difficult to climb through."


The film studio south is south of film studio north. "This end of the film studio looks like the aftermath of a particularly exuberant action flick.  Tables, chairs and assorted props have been hurled about, some of it even broken in the process, and a fist-sized hole has been punched into one wall.  It's a little less untidy to the north, and the door to the hallway is to the west."

The hole is scenery in the film studio south. "[one of]'Aidan did that,' Ava says.  'Lucian made a run for it right then, while Aidan was trying to pull his fist out of the hole.  I don't know what would have happened if he hadn't missed.'[or]Through the hole in the wall, you can see the various layers of drywall and acoustic panelling that make up the studio walls.  It's quite impressive, not to mention frightening, how deep the hole is.[stopping]"


The southeast corner of Claremont is a room. "You're at a T-junction, of sorts.  Hallways stretch off to the north and west; another hallway stretches off to the south, ramping up slightly as it passes from this building to the next.  You catch sight of two of the counselors pacing about at the end of the southern hallway; fortunately, they haven't seen you ... yet.  The door to the auditorium where you were supposed to spend this morning working on your satirical drama class is to the east."

The eastern hallway is a room. "A utilitarian, academic hallway, stretching north and south.  Two empty classrooms are on the west side.  On the east side, the door to the backstage areas of the auditorium is to the southeast, while half of the film studio lies northeast."

The northeast corner of Claremont is a room. "The hallway makes an elbow here, heading off to the south and the west.  To the east is the film studio.  You can tell because the door has been torn off its hinges, giving you a perfectly unimpeded view of the studio within.  Another set of doors, to the north, leads out of the building, but those are intact."

The northern hallway is a room. "You are at a T-junction.  The hallway goes east and west, and another hallway joins it from the south.  To the north, wide double doors open into the library."

The northwest corner of Claremont is a room. "The hallway goes east and south from here.  To the north is an exit from the building.  You notice a door, previously locked, has been smashed open; beyond it, stairs lead down into the basement.  You can easily sense that Aidan has been here: you can trace two trails, one going down the stairs and another running off to the south."

The central hallway of Claremont is a room. "A utilitarian, academic hallway, stretching north and south.  Empty classrooms are in all other directions."

The southwest corner of Claremont is a room. "Not actually a corner, but enough of one for your purposes: the counselors standing guard to the south make you rather hesitant to wander off in that direction.  Fortunately, they're more concerned with keeping the other students from coming over onto this side, and aren't looking behind them for people who've already done so.  That leaves the north and the east open to travel."

The southern hallway is a room. "You are in a utilitarian east-west hallway.  Another hallway from the north connects here."

The western hallway is a room. "A utilitarian, academic hallway, stretching north and south.  Empty classrooms are in all other directions."

Chapter 1 - action and actions in Claremont

The two pacing counselors are a backdrop in the southeast corner of Claremont and in the southwest corner of Claremont. "They look nervous as they pace back and forth."

Check going to an exterior room when in chapter 7 and in the Claremont Hall region: say "As you put your hand on the exit door, Ava stops you, saying, 'We can't leave yet!  We've got to help Lucian!'" instead.

Report searching an unimportant classroom (called the spot): say "A quick search reveals nothing out of the ordinary.  [if something taints the spot]Aside from the ripped-out ventilation grill, anyway.  [end if]Lucian hasn't been by this way; or if he has, he's been remarkably calm for someone who's supposedly in a blind panic." instead.

Check facing east when in the northeast corner of Claremont: say "[the description of the film studio north][line break]" instead. 

First check going east from the eastern hallway: say "There's two doors in the east wall:  the film studio, northeast, and the auditorium, southeast." instead.

[Check going to the film studio south from the eastern hallway: say "The door won't budge.  [if Ava follows the player][one of]Ava shakes her head.  'We have to go in through the north entrance.'[or][stopping][end if] [line break]" instead.  Check facing northeast when in the eastern hallway: say "The viewing window is cracked, and it is dark within." instead.]

Chapter 2 - more maps 

The Claremont library is a room. "The Education And Fine Arts Library, as befits the University of Colorado at Valmont, is a labyrinth stacked high with books and simply lousy with hidden corners and dead ends.  Thankfully, most of it is also sealed away beyond a security barrier, and as far as you can tell, no-one is likely to have slipped through to the stacks beyond.  The only part of the library you can really access from here is the circulation desk, which has been positioned directly under an air vent to allow the librarians the full benefit of the heating system during the cold winter semester.  And also to blow papers off the desk, but none of the librarians have complained about that one little detail, oddly enough."

The circulation desk is an enterable supporter, scenery, in the Claremont library. "This is actually only half the circulation desk, the other half being on the other side of the security barrier.  Plaques indicate that one may drop off one's returns here, or pick up whatever books one has placed on reserve.  It is covered with stacks of papers and forms, each stack weighted down by a paperweight[if Ava is on the circulation desk and the player is on the circulation desk] or yourselves[otherwise if Ava is on the circulation desk], or Ava herself[otherwise if the player is on the circulation desk] or yourself[end if]."

Some paperweights are scenery on the circulation desk. "They're a variety of shapes and sizes and materials, and range from a simple cobblestone to an elaborately etched hunk of glass." Understand "paperweight" or "paper weight/weights" as the paperweights.

Check taking the paperweights: say "There's enough chaos going on without taking a paperweight and letting all those papers blow about the place." instead.

Some papers are scenery on the circulation desk. "Who knew that the business of managing a library entailed so much bureaucracy?  The papers rustle under the breeze from the vent above.  [if we have entered the circulation desk]A few stacks of papers have been shifted aside to make way for dirty footprints to be imprinted on the nice, clean desk top."

Some footprints are scenery. "Strangely, they look to be about your size."

Carry out entering the circulation desk: move the footprints to the circulation desk.
The block climbing rule is not listed in the check climbing rulebook.
The block climbing rule is listed in the report climbing rulebook.

The library air vent is an air vent in the Claremont library. "It is positioned directly over the circulation desk.  You can feel hot air blowing from it, and something else, too: fear.  It seems stronger here than elsewhere[if the library air vent is open].  The grill that used to cover it has been removed and tossed aside[end if]."


Report unlocking the library air vent with the screwdriver: say "As you begin to turn the screws, you feel something warm against your back: it feels almost like approval.  You turn around, and find Aidan standing at the entrance to the library, grinning malevolently.  You freeze, and you hear Ava gasp, and before you can do anything further, Aidan has leapt up on the desk (knocking you off in the process) and ripped the grill from the vent opening.  He flings the grill away -- it skims over the security barrier -- and begins feeling around inside the vent.  For a moment, you think it's all over for Lucian, but despite his panic Lucian has enough sense to keep out of reach and remain silent.  Aidan snarls in frustration, and is gone in a blur of speed." instead.


The HVAC room is down from the northwest corner of Claremont. "This is essentially a concrete basement full of pipes and maintenance equipment.  The master HVAC unit takes up half the space, and all the vents and chutes and pipes coming into or out of it takes up almost all the rest."

The pipes are scenery in the HVAC room. "The number of these things twisting around is quite bewildering." Understand "chutes/chute" as the pipes. Understand "vents/vent" as the pipes when in the HVAC room.

The HVAC unit is scenery in the HVAC room. "Essentially a furnace, generating hot air which is then pumped up to all the rooms of the building above.  The central thermostat, here, regulates the general temperature.  [if the thermostat is switched on]Judging by the roaring sound, it's working overtime to generate as much heat as it possibly can.[otherwise]The unit is completely silent." Understand "furnace" as the HVAC unit.

The thermostat is a scenery device, part of the HVAC unit. "The central thermostat consists of a simple dial which can be turned, and a meter above showing the temperature of the building.  [if the thermostat is switched on]Someone has set the the thermostat to the maximum!  The meter is slowly but surely climbing towards the danger zone.[otherwise]Everything seems normal, though the meter shows that the temperature is a little on the warm side.  It'll be a while before it returns to normal." The thermostat is switched on. Understand "dial/dials" as the thermostat when in the HVAC room. 

Instead of setting or turning the thermostat: if the thermostat is switched on, try switching off the thermostat; otherwise try switching on the thermostat.

Check switching off the HVAC unit: say "'If Stacy were here, she would have found the controls for this thing already,' says Ava, staring at the monstrous machine.  'Of course, Stacy isn't very patient when the CD player needs changing, either.'" instead.
Check switching on the HVAC unit: say "'I think we're doing OK,' says Ava." instead.

Report switching off the thermostat: say "You quickly turn the thermostat down to a more normal setting.  Immediately, the HVAC unit falls silent.  It'll be a while before the temperature drops back to normal, but at least it's not rising." instead.
Check switching on the thermostat: say "You fiddle with the thermostat dial, looking for a more optimum setting." instead.

[First carry out going from the HVAC room when the HVAC unit is switched off for the first time: say "'That's a relief.'".]

Book 6 - Aidan's Mindscape

Part 1 - Battlefield for chapter 7 only

The battlefield is a room. "Everything is black and white, and grainy as an old photograph.  The ground is barren and scored with trenches; the sky is filled with stormclouds.  A fierce wind threatens to knock you off your feet, as bombshells rain about you."

The trenches are scenery in the battlefield. "Trenches crisscross the ground; where they aren't filled with mud, they're filled with sharp rocks and nasty bits of twisted shrapnel."  Before doing something to the backdrop-floor when in the battlefield, now the noun is the trenches.

The bombshells are scenery in the battlefield. "You're not quite crazy enough to get close enough to one of the shells to examine it.  They fall, they explode, they send bits and pieces of themselves flying through the air, and it's a miracle you haven't been sliced to ribbons by the flying shrapnel already." Understand "shrapnel/shells" as the bombshells.

The stormclouds are scenery in the battlefield. "The stormclouds race across the sky, driven by the mad winds."  Before doing something to the backdrop-sky when in the battlefield, now the noun is the stormclouds.

The wind is scenery in the battlefield. "It's insane.  But listening very carefully, you think you hear ... a voice?  No, you've lost it again...."

Check going when in the battlefield: say "The wind drives you back." instead.

Check focusing on when in the battlefield: say "An insane, murderous rage threatens to overwhelm you." instead.

Part 2 - mind map for chapter 9

The mindscape is a region. 

Chapter 1 - house & mountain

The living room is a room. "You are standing in your living room.  At least, it looks just like your living room back home, except for the [if we have not folded the rug]large oriental rug sitting right where the stairs used to be.[otherwise]trap door in the floor where the stairs used to be.[end if]  The kitchen is off to the east, just as you remember it.  And Dad's trophy case, there in the corner, seems a little larger and more imposing than you remember, come to think of it."

The trophy case is scenery in the living room. "It's stuffed full of old report cards and the like; Dad's souvenirs and memorabilia are barely visible."

The memorabilia is scenery in the living room. "You don't remember half of this stuff.  No wait, you do: you just never bother to think about it much." Understand "cards/souvenirs/card/souvenir" as the memorabilia. 

The oriental rug is scenery in the living room. "It's slightly dusty, but clearly a high-quality Persian, worth at least 20% of what the carpet seller was originally asking.[if we have not folded the rug]  It lies flat on the floor, its geometric pattern somehow creating an illusion of depth.[otherwise]  It's been rolled up and pushed to one side, revealing a trap door in the floor." The printed name of the oriental rug is "[if we have folded the oriental rug]rolled-up [end if]oriental rug".

The trap door is a scenery door. The trap door is down from the living room and up from the crossroads. The description is "The trap door is an over-engineered affair of heavy oak and ironwork, not the sort of thing one expects to find in a modern suburban house."  Before doing something except going with the trap door when we have not folded the oriental rug, say "You can't see any such thing." instead. First check going down from the living room when we have not folded the oriental rug: try listing exits instead.

Rule for implicitly taking the oriental rug: now the player carries the oriental rug. 
Check pulling the oriental rug: try folding the oriental rug instead.
Check pushing the oriental rug: try folding the oriental rug instead.
Check folding the oriental rug: say "Rolling up the large rug, you reveal a trap door underneath."; [now the trap door is down from the living room;] ; now the oriental rug is in the location; rule succeeds.

First report opening the trap door: say "The trap door pulls open with surprising ease, almost as if it were weightless." instead.

First report closing the trap door: say "The trap door falls shut again with a loud bang, sending billows of dust into the air." instead.

The kitchen is east of the living room. "This looks almost exactly like your kitchen back home, except that the door to the basement is missing.  Also, there's a blank wall where the entrance to the dining room used to be.  The kitchen table is pushed up under a window, just as it has always been, but the chairs are missing."

The blank wall is scenery in the kitchen. "Why would anyone leave this wall intentionally blank?"

The kitchen window is a scenery closed [transparent] door. The description is "It looks out onto the back yard.  Normally you'd be able to see the neighboring houses, but nothing seems to exist beyond the back yard fence." The kitchen window is east of the kitchen and west of the mountain view.

The kitchen table is scenery in the kitchen. "It's just a cheap work table that Mom has had since college.  It's very battered, but also very sturdy."  Some binoculars are on the kitchen table. "[placeholder]Binoculars[end placeholder]."

The mountain view is an exterior room. "The ground just drops away a short distance away from the house, descending straight down into the clouds miles below.  The only solid object you can see beyond the clouds is a mountain far off into the distance.  The only way back into the house is through the kitchen window." 

Check jumping when in the mountain view: placeholder "Leaping off into the void, the clouds you fall through obscure your vision, instilling unreasoning terror as you can not see your doom approach."; false death instead.


GOAL_LIGHT-BRINGER is a goal. The printed name is "Bring Light to the Darkness".  The win condition is "[if a dark room lit up is true][goal achieved]For a brief moment, you thought you heard the distant cawing of birds.[paragraph break]".  A dark room lit up is a truth state that varies.  Before printing the announcement of light when in chapter 9 (this is the light-bringer brought rule): now a dark room lit up is true. First carry out going when the room gone to is a dark room and in chapter 9: if GOAL_LIGHT-BRINGER is unachieved begin; add GOAL_LIGHT-BRINGER to the current goals, if absent; if the player has something lit, now a dark room lit up is true; end if. Carry out taking the brass lantern: if GOAL_LIGHT-BRINGER is unachieved, add GOAL_LIGHT-BRINGER to the current goals, if absent.

GOAL_REVIVE_AIDAN is a goal. The printed name is "Revive Aidan". The win condition is "[if old-Aidan wears one ring][goal achieved]Again, off in the distance.  The cawing of birds.[paragraph break]". 

GOAL_DEFEAT_THIEF is a goal. The printed name is "Defeat the Thief". The win condition is "[if the turns until the thief appears > 100][goal achieved]".

[after sword, so, after lake bottom]
GOAL_PIERCE_THE_VEIL is a goal. The printed name is "Pierce the Veil". The win condition is "[if we have attacked the red curtain][goal achieved]". First carry out going from the curtain room for the first time: add GOAL_PIERCE_THE_VEIL to the current goals, if absent.

The chapter 9 task list is a list of goals that varies. The chapter 9 task list is { GOAL_LIGHT-BRINGER, GOAL_REVIVE_AIDAN, GOAL_DEFEAT_THIEF, GOAL_PIERCE_THE_VEIL }.

The mountain symbol is scenery in the mountain view. "[if all birds are there]The mountain rises straight up from the clouds.  An amorphous black mass, a blot on the otherwise serene landscape, covers its peak.[otherwise if half the birds are gone]The mountain rises straight up from the clouds, its ice-covered peak glinting in the sunlight.  You think you can see a face in the ice, but it is obscured by a shifting black mass that, interestingly enough, seems to have taken the shape of a domino mask.[otherwise if we have attacked the mountain symbol]The mountain rises straight up from the clouds.  Surprisingly, given the altitude, its peak is covered with green grass.  You think you can see goats frolicking about.[otherwise]The mountain rises straight up from the clouds, its ice-covered peak glinting in the sunlight.  In the ice, you can see Aidan's face, scowling murderously back at you."  The printed name of the mountain-symbol is "mountain". Understand "ice/icy" as the mountain symbol when we have not attacked the mountain symbol. 

The amorphous black mass is scenery in the mountain view. "[if searching the binoculars]Birds!  Through the binoculars, you can see that the shifting cloud of blackness is made up of thousands of inky-black birds![otherwise]It shifts slightly, enough so you can tell that it's not a single, solid entity."  Understand "shape" as the amorphous black mass.  Check searching ["looking through"] the binoculars when in the mountain view: say the description of the amorphous black mass instead. [Understand "look through/thru [something] [text]" as searching. Understand "look [text] with/through/using [something]" as searching.]  Check searching the binoculars when the player is in an interior room: say "The binoculars don't seem to be very useful indoors." instead.

The clouds are scenery in the mountain view. "You're higher up above the clouds than you have ever been, even in a plane, and if there's anything below those clouds, well, now is not the time to find out."

The house is scenery in the mountain view. "Well, it looks like your house.  Even though it contains only the living room and kitchen.  Most of the windows seem obscured, somehow, except for the kitchen window through which you got here in the first place."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the backdrop-sky when in the mountain view: say "The world may be filled with sunlight, but you can't see any other sign of the sun anywhere." Understand "sun/sky/sunlight" as the backdrop-sky when in the mountain view.

The living room, the kitchen, and the mountain view are in the mindscape. 

Check attacking the mountain symbol when all birds are gone: placeholder "The ice shatters."; rule succeeds.

Check throwing a smooth rock at when in the mountain view:
	now the smooth rock is off-stage;
	unless all birds are gone:
		if we have not searched the binoculars, say "Your throw, while unnaturally strong and accurate, is swallowed up by the dark mass." instead;
		if the amorphous black mass is in the location, say "You kill one bird, among thousands." instead;
	try attacking the mountain symbol instead.


Chapter 2 - Crossroads

The crossroads are a room. "You are standing at a crossroads.  A signpost indicates exits to the north, [if the red button is switched off]south, [end if]east, and west; the lamp perched on the top of the signpost does not illuminate enough of the area that you can actually see these exits, so having these indicators is a great help.  A spiral staircase leads back upwards.  You can faintly hear someone playing the blues on an alto sax." The crossroads are exterior.

Definition: a direction (called forward) is valid rather than invalid if the room forward from the location is a room.

[TODO northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest.  Or south, when the red button has been switched on: ]

Check going an invalid direction when in the crossroads: say "[if player has something lit]You bravely march off into the shadows in that direction.  For a while, you can see nothing around you except for the ground at your feet and the shadows beyond the light ... and then you finally arrive at...[paragraph break][try looking][otherwise]You hesitantly walk off into the shadows, but turn back when it becomes clear that the lamplight from the signpost isn't going to penetrate far enough into the darkness to allow you to find anything." instead.

Check searching the binoculars:
	if in the crossroads, say "It's dark as far as the eye can see, in every direction." instead;
	if in the Xroads, say "It's dark in every direction, as far as the eye can see." instead;
	if in the lake bottom or in beneath the surface or in the lake shore or in the maintenance room, say "It's water as far as the eye can see." instead;
	if in the land of the dead or in the fork, say "It's dead air in every direction." instead;

The alto sax is scenery in the crossroads. "It's very very film-noir.  Also, pervasive." Understand "blues" as the alto sax. 

The signpost is scenery in the crossroads. "
West: Death and Maintenance[line break]
East: Art, Enlightenment and Soul[line break]
North: Knowledge[line break]
[if the red button is switched off]South: Alph[line break][end if]"

The twisty passages 1 are a room. "You are in a completely unsurprising maze of twisty passages, all alike."

The twisty passages 2 are west of twisty passages 1. "You are in a completely unsurprising maze of twisty passages, all alike.  Well, not all of them completely alike: the passage sloping upwards from here runs right beside a large rockfall."

The rockfall is a scenery dispenser in the twisty passages 2. The description is "The rocks are round, flat, very smooth, and very regular.  They look as if each would fit quite comfortably in your palm.  Half-buried beneath the pile of rocks is a sign which says 'Lair Sweet Lair'."  The rockfall vends a smooth rock. A smooth rock is a thing. Understand "rock", "stone", "smooth" as the rockfall when the rockfall is in the location and a smooth rock is not in the location. Understand "stone" as the smooth rock.

The sign is scenery in the twisty passages 2. "'Lair Sweet Lair'.  It looks rather homey and comforting, all things considered."

The twisty passages 3 are up from the twisty passages 2. "[placeholder][item described][end placeholder]."

The twisty passages 4 are up from the twisty passages 3. "[placeholder][item described][end placeholder]."

The twisty passages 5 are south of the twisty passages 4. "[placeholder][item described][end placeholder]."

The twisty passages 1, the twisty passages 2, the twisty passages 3, the twisty passages 4, the twisty passages 5 are in the mindscape.

The fork is west of the crossroads. "The shadowy passage from the east forks here, to the northwest and southwest.  A dim glow can be discerned at the end of the northwest fork; to the southwest, you can see only darkness."

The land of the dead is northwest of the fork. "You are on a vast, perfectly flat plain of ice.  A platform of some sort has been built out of dry twigs in the middle of the plain; Aidan is lying on it, his arms crossed sedately over his chest.  [if the spirits are in the location]The spirits of the dead crowd all around, chanting and wailing and gibbering, and preventing you from approaching the platform.[otherwise]It is completely and utterly silent." Check listening when in the land of the dead: try looking instead.

The spirits are scenery in the land of the dead. "There are shades of every sort of person from every sort of culture and time period, from Viking berserkers to Mandarin courtiers to Victorian fops.  None of them look particularly pleasant, presumably because any remotely nice members of the dearly departed have gone to heaven; which rather implies that this is The Other Place."

Check examining Exorcism when the spirits are in the location: placeholder "Begone!"; remove the spirits from play; now all rings are in the location; placeholder "The spirits dissipate.  Two gold rings drop from thin air."  instead.

The maintenance room is southwest of the fork. "This looks suspiciously like the bridge of your Dad's ship, at least what you remember of it from your visit to the naval base a couple of years ago.  Banks of controls line the walls, most of them blinking and beyond complicated.  One solitary terminal, separate from the others, seems simple enough, however.  Through a door to the northeast, which you do not remember opening to get in here, is the passage back to the fork." The maintenance room is dark interior.

The terminal is scenery in the maintenance room. "This terminal consists of a monitor screen, a red button, and a blue button.  The screen shows six boxes, labeled A to F: A and B in the top row, and the remaining four in the bottom row.  Horizontal lines connect boxes A to B, [if the red button is switched on]C to D, [end if][if the blue button is switched on] E to F,[end if] and D to E.[if the red button is switched off]  A vertical line joins boxes A and D.[end if][if the blue button is switched off]  Finally, a diagonal line joins boxes B and E.[end if]"

The banks of controls is scenery in the maintenance room. "With all these blinking lights, it's surprising that you needed to bring a light source into this room to dispel the darkness."

Instead of doing something when the banks of controls are physically involved, say "Probably not a good idea.  These controls are ridiculously complicated, and who knows what damage you might cause just by sneezing at them."

The fork, the crossroads, the land of the dead, the maintenance room are in the mindscape.

Section 1 - push my buttons, move my world

First check pushing a device (this is the allow pushing device buttons rule): [formerly a procedural rule]

	otherwise try switching off the noun instead. 	
[	ignore the can't push what's fixed in place rule; 
	ignore the can't push scenery rule. ]

[Carry out pushing a device (this is the pushbutton device rule): if the noun is switched off, try silently switching on the noun; otherwise try silently switching off the noun. Report pushing a device: rule succeeds.]

The blue button is a device, part of the terminal [in the maintenance room]. The description is "The blue button is labeled with the greek letter alpha.  It is currently [if the blue button is switched off]not [end if]pressed." Understand "alpha" as the blue button. 

Report switching on the blue button (this is the blue pushbutton rule):

Section 2 - old Aidan's bier

The platform is enterable scenery supporter in the land of the dead. "It looks rather uncomfortably like a funeral pyre.  It probably IS a funeral pyre.  So the last thing you want to do is to bring an open flame too close to it."  Check entering the platform: say "No thank you." instead. Understand "funeral" or "pyre" as the platform.

The old-Aidan is scenery, person, proper-named on the platform. "[if old-Aidan wears zero rings]He looks grey and cold and lifeless.  His hands are crossed at the wrist, over his chest, fingers splayed.  For some reason, he's dressed up as Robin Hood.[otherwise if old-Aidan wears one ring]He looks like he's asleep.  His hands are crossed at the wrist, over his chest, fingers splayed.  For some reason, he's dressed up as Robin Hood.  A single gold ring glints on one finger.[otherwise if old-Aidan wears two rings]He looks feverish, like he's in pain.  He's wearing a pair of matching rings." The printed name of the old-Aidan is "Aidan". [hyphenated to prevent parser disambiguation messages.] Understand "Aidan", "brother/bro" as old-Aidan.  After deciding the scope of the player when old-Aidan is enclosed by the location: if old-Aidan wears a ring (called R), place R in scope.

First check putting a ring on old-Aidan: now old-Aidan wears the noun; say "[if old-Aidan wears two rings]As you slip the second ring onto Aidan's finger, the heat around him increases and you begin to see steam rising from his body.  His face flushes with fever.  Meanwhile, there's a dry, crackling sound coming from the platform now, and the smell of scorching.[otherwise]As you slip the ring onto Aidan's finger, a warm glow seems to spread from his hands and up to his face.  He looks somehow peaceful, as if he were just taking a nap."; rule succeeds. [ WEAR is an action that you can't do to another; furthermore, Aidan can't WEAR what you are holding; hence this first check rule that does everything ]

Check removing a ring from old-Aidan: now the player carries the noun; say "[if old-Aidan wears exactly one ring]The temperature drops back down to something more comfortable, and Aidan himself loses the feverish look and returns to a more comfortable-looking state of unconsciousness.[otherwise]Aidan's face turns grey and ashen as the temperature drops." instead. Rule for implicitly taking a ring (called R) when old-Aidan wears R: try removing R from old-Aidan; now the player wears R.First check taking off a ring: if old-Aidan wears the noun, try removing the noun from old-Aidan instead.

Check attacking old-Aidan: say "You can't bring yourself to attack your brother while he's down.  Also, given that you're currently walking around inside his head, killing him would probably be a very bad idea." instead.

Check waking old-Aidan: say "He sleeps the sleep of the dead.  You only hope he's not actually dead." instead.


Chapter 3 - the Xroads

The Xroads are east of the crossroads. "You are standing at an Xroads, which differ from a mere crossroads in that the roads go off diagonally, that is, to the northeast, southeast, [if the blue button is switched off]southwest, [end if]and northwest.  Another narrow path goes back west to the crossroads." The Xroads are exterior.

The right corner is south of the crossroads. "You are in a passageway that goes east and [if the red button is switched on]west[otherwise]north[end if].  It seems absolutely ordinary in every way." Understand "passageway" as the right corner. 

The obtuse corner is east of the right corner. "You are in a passageway that goes west and [if the blue button is switched on]east[otherwise]northeast[end if].  It seems absolutely ordinary in every way." Understand "passageway" as the obtuse corner.  The obtuse corner is southwest of the Xroads.

The by-the-tree is northwest of the Xroads. "You are standing in the middle of a forest, which is interesting because you cannot for the life of you remember the point at which the underground passageway, which you recall as being to the southeast, suddenly turned into a forest path.  Just as interesting is the gigantic tree here, towering high above all the other trees and penetrating the cloud cover far above.  [if no puzzles solved]Lifeless and hollow, it's only a matter of time before it collapses and buries half the forest beneath it.[otherwise if a few puzzles solved]Withered and dry, it's only barely alive.  There's a hollow space inside that's almost large enough to live in.[otherwise if most puzzles solved]It looks distinctly unhealthy, with a hollow knot big enough to stand in.[otherwise if all puzzles solved]Other than a few signs of blight about its trunk, it's remarkably healthy.[end if]".  The printed name of the by-the-tree is "tree". Understand "tree" as the by-the-tree.

A scenery thing called the tree of life is in the by-the-tree.  "[if no puzzles solved]It's amazing that it's still standing at all.  It's so hollow that you could almost swear that it's all bark and nothing else.  Actually, looking into the hollow, you can see a ladder descending down into the tree's roots.[otherwise if a few puzzles solved]It's still alive, but only barely.  Through a hole in its side, you can see a hollow space as large as your living room back home, with a stair cut into the living wood leading down.
[otherwise if most puzzles solved]It doesn't look healthy, but it's mostly alive.  There's a hollow bit in its side that's just big enough for you to stand in.[otherwise if all puzzles solved]Except for its size, it looks like any other tree you've seen.  Solid and healthy, it could probably reign over the forest for a thousand years or so."  Rule for clarifying the parser's choice of the tree of life: do nothing.

The hollow of the tree is scenery, part of the tree of life. "[if no puzzles solved]It takes up the entire inside of the tree.  A ladder leads down into the tree's roots.[otherwise if a few puzzles solved]It takes up a good portion of the tree trunk.  A stair, cut into the wood, spirals down into the tree's roots.[otherwise if most puzzles solved]It's just a hollow space in the side of the tree.  It's big enough to stand in, but that's all there is to it.[otherwise if all puzzles solved]It's gone!"

The ladder is scenery, part of the tree of life. "It looks quite rickety, and descends deep beneath the tree."

The life-tree stairs is scenery in by-the-tree.  "They're carved out from the living wood inside the tree, and descend deep beneath the tree." The printed name of the life-tree stairs is "stairs".

The life-tree clouds are scenery in by-the-tree. "They're fluffy and white and clearly indicate that you are outside rather than underground.[If the Mountain View has been visited]  Funny, you don't remember having descended quite so far as to have gotten beneath the clouds.". The printed name of the life-tree clouds is "clouds". 

The trees-scenery are scenery in by-the-tree. "They obscure your view of the forest." The printed name of the trees-scenery is "trees".

The dark spot is down from by-the-tree. "[placeholder]dark spot[end placeholder]." [The dark spot is dark.]

A brass lantern is a device in the dark spot. "[placeholder][item described][end placeholder]."  Carry out switching on the brass lantern: now the brass lantern is lit.  Carry out switching off the brass lantern: now the brass lantern is unlit. Check burning the lantern: try switching on the lantern instead. Understand "snuff [device]" or "douse [device]" or "blow [device] out/on" or "blow out/on [device]" or "kill [device]" as switching off.

The curtain room is northeast of the Xroads. "You are in a perfectly cubical room, with wall-to-wall carpeting and wood-paneled walls.  An archway at the southwest corner leads back towards the Xroads.[if we have not attacked the red curtain]  The entire east wall is taken up by a red curtain that wafts and rustles in the nonexistent breeze.[otherwise]  To the east, a narrow flight of stairs descends down into darkness."

The red curtain is scenery in the curtain room. "It stretches from ceiling to floor, and from wall to wall.  You can't see anything through it, but there is no way any curtain could move like that unless there were a window or something on the other side, with a wind blowing against it."

Check attacking the red curtain when the player has the sword: say "The sword sings as it slices through the air and the curtain, cutting through it as if it were nothing but light and shadows.  The fabric seems to dissolve into tendrils of mist as it falls apart, finally leaving the way east open."; now the deepest place is mapped down of the curtain room; now the deepest place is mapped east of the curtain room; rule succeeds. [east? down?]

The wood panels are scenery in the curtain room. "It all looks like something out of the 1960s." Understand "carpet/walls" as the wood panels.

The deepest place is a room. "[present the thief][placeholder]deepest place[end placeholder]  ".

The art gallery is southeast of the Xroads. "This was clearly an art gallery once, but the walls are bare: you can see squares and rectangles of unfaded wallpaper where paintings used to hang.  An archway in the northwest corner would take you back to the Xroads." The art gallery is dark.

Exorcism is in the art gallery. "Only one painting still remains on the wall, and it's not a painting at all: it's a calligraphy scroll of some kind." The description is "[placeholder]A canvas whose only decorations are words. It is labeled 'Exorcism'[end placeholder]." Understand "scroll" or "calligraphy" or "painting" as Exorcism.

The classroom-shadow is north of the crossroads. "Looks like you're back in school again.  There's the old chalkboard, and all the familiar desks and chairs, all looking a little smaller than you remember.  By contrast, the teacher's desk looms menacingly at one shadowy end of the room.  There is an exit to the south." The printed name of the classroom-shadow is "classroom". The classroom-shadow is dark.

Check examining the player when in the classroom-shadow: say "You appear to not be naked this time round, which is something of a relief." instead.

The desks-shadow are scenery in the classroom-shadow. "They look rather small for you.  Could this have been first grade?" Understand "chairs" as the desks-shadow. The printed name of the desks-shadow is "desks".

The teacher's desk is scenery in the classroom-shadow. "It's rather large and ominous."

The chalkboard is scenery in the classroom-shadow. "Someone has written 'I will not leave the lights on when I leave the room' 57 times on the board." Understand "blackboard" as the chalkboard. 

Aidan's essay is a thing in the classroom-shadow. "[if Aidan's essay is unlit]A folded-up piece of paper[otherwise][placeholder]The paper has a long comment in bright red ink asserting that this level of writing couldn’t possibly be his own work and demanding that Aidan reveal where he copied from. The ink still looks wet, and glows as bright as the lantern.[end placeholder]".  Understand "classroom", "paper" as Aidan's essay when in chapter 9.

Check folding Aidan's essay: say "You fold back up [the noun]."; now Aidan's essay is unlit; rule succeeds. 
Check opening Aidan's essay: say "You unfold [the noun]."; now Aidan's essay is lit; rule succeeds. [ Obviously, this light shouldn’t be available until Daniel has already brought the lantern into the room. ]

The Xroads, the classroom-shadow, the by-the-tree, the right corner, the obtuse corner, the dark spot, the curtain room, the art gallery are in the mindscape.

Understand the command "smear" as "rub". Check rubbing Aidan's essay: placeholder "It immediately re-forms its letters."  instead.


Chapter 4 - the Lake

There is a room called the lake shore.  "You stand on the shores of what should more properly be called a sea: it is enormous, its far shores lost beyond the reach of any light.  The ceiling of the cavern is lost in the darkness as well; it is so high up that it is entirely possible that there is in fact no ceiling, and that the darkness above is a starless, moonless sky.  Faint music wafts down from above, and the only visible exit is to the west.". [The printed name of the lake shore is "by the lake". ]Understand "lake" as the lake shore.

The music is scenery in the lake shore. "Somehow, you know that it's a dulcimer, though you've never actually heard one before.  It sounds quite exotic."

The ice is scenery in the lake shore.  "It seems solid enough."  

A scenery thing called the lake is in the lake shore. "[if after clarification]The lake is dark and very deep: you can't see the bottom, though the water seems marvelously clear.[otherwise if the ice is in the lake shore and we have attacked the ice]The icy face seems to be sneering at you.[otherwise if the ice is in the lake shore]The lake is dark and inky, and covered over with a thick layer of ice.  Curiously, the marbled patterns of bubbles in the ice seem to form the vague appearance of a face.  A face wearing a domino mask.[otherwise if before clarification]The lake is dark and inky.  A closer examination reveals that the 'water' is in fact opaque, and might more properly be called 'ink'.  Fortunately, it doesn't seem to leave any lingering stains." Understand "inky/ink/inkyness" as the lake when before clarification. 

Check entering the lake when the ice is in the lake shore: say "You walk out across the ice, and despite your best efforts to keep in a straight line, find yourself emerging right where you started." instead.

Check entering the lake when the ice is NOT in the lake shore: try going down instead.

Check attacking the ice: say "Violence might be the answer to this one, but you can't seem to summon up quite enough violence to do anything more than hurt yourself."; rule succeeds.

Check throwing a smooth rock at when in the lake shore: 
	if the ice is in the location:
		placeholder "The lake ice shatters. See Rock in file Objects01";   [TODO]
		remove the ice from play; 
		rule succeeds;
	otherwise:
		try putting the smooth rock on the lake instead.
	

Check putting a smooth rock on the lake: say "[if after clarification]You watch as the rock sinks down towards the lake bottom; eventually, however, it sinks beyond the reach of the light, and is swallowed up by the distant darkness.[otherwise if the ice is in the location]You drop the rock on the ice.  It bounces harmlessly off the cold, hard surface.[otherwise]The rock is swallowed up immediately by the inky blackness."; if the ice is in the location, now the smooth rock is in the location; rule fails.


beneath the surface is down from the lake shore. "[if before clarification]All you can see is ink.  The fact that it's opaque makes the possession of a light source, or lack thereof, rather immaterial.[otherwise if after clarification and the player does not wear the night vision goggles]You hover just a foot below the surface.  It's too dark to go much deeper.[otherwise]All you have to go on is an innate sense of up and down:  all around you, for as far as you can see, is cold, clear water."

Check going down from beneath the surface when after clarification and the player does not wear the night vision goggles: say "It's too dark to go deeper." instead.

The inky water is scenery in beneath the surface. "It's all around you, freezing cold and dark and clammy.  [if player is wearing a ring]Luckily, the warmth from the ring on your finger is sufficient to keep you from turning into an iceberg." Understand "ink/inky/inkyness" as the inky water when before clarification.


The lake bottom is down from beneath the surface. "You are finally at the bottom of the lake, a vast desert of silt softly shifting with the currents.  Amid the billowing silt is a monolithic, hexagonal block of black basalt[If the player does not have the sword].  A sword, glowing a dim blue, has been plunged halfway into the basalt[end if]."

Some silt is scenery in the lake bottom. "Very fine sand, almost cloud-like as it shifts beneath you."

The hexagonal block of basalt is scenery container in the lake bottom. The description is "Something has been crudely etched into its side: squinting at it out of the corner of your eye, you can just barely make out the words, 'Cthulhu heart Shub-Niggurath.'"

The elvish sword is in the hexagonal block. The description is "[placeholder]An elvish sword of great antiquity.[end placeholder]"

The inkyness is a backdrop.  The inkyness is in the lake bottom, beneath the surface, and the lake shore.

	no.

Check throwing Aidan's essay at the lake: clarify the lake instead.
Check inserting Aidan's essay into the lake: clarify the lake instead.
Check putting Aidan's essay on the lake: clarify the lake instead.

To clarify the lake: placeholder "Lake clears when touched by Aidan's essay."; remove the inkyness from play.

Chapter 8 - the Den of the Thief

The thief's den is up from the twisty passages 4. "You have managed to find your way into the thief's den, a seedy little place higher than it is wide and lined with shelves displaying the thief's ill-gotten gains.  The only piece of furniture appears to be a dirty mattress on the floor.  A spiral stair winds back up to the twisty passages of the maze."

The mattress is scenery in the thief's den. "It's filthy and probably infested with bedbugs."

The shelves are scenery in the thief's den. "The shelves are crowded with all sorts of things, ranging from priceless works of art to odds-and-ends picked out of other people's pockets.  None of it seems very useful to you."

Book 1 - Scavenger Hunt scene

Scavenger Hunting is a chapter-length scene. Scavenger Hunting begins when the entire game begins.

Scavenger Hunting ends naturally when the time of day is after 8:24 PM and the chapter number is 1.
Scavenger Hunting ends victoriously when every scavenger hunt goal is achieved and the player can see Michelle.

When Scavenger Hunting ends naturally:
	say "8:25!  Time's up!  You hurry back to the starting point with your list[if the player has something that fulfills a goal] and everything you've found so far[end if]....";
	move the player to first floor lobby west;
	if every scavenger hunt goal is achieved:
		say "Michelle takes your list, then searches about herself for a pencil (completely missing the one behind her ear and the two pens in her pocket) before finally pulling out a magic marker.  She nods as she ticks off the items from the list.  'Nice going, Daniel,' she says, smiling, 'that's everything on the list.  You win!'  She slaps a blue ribbon on your chest and turns to address the next camper.[paragraph break]The numb sensation in the side of your head takes a few moments to clear completely.";
	otherwise if at least one scavenger hunt goal is achieved:
		say "Michelle scans your list, looks over your findings, and shakes her head.  'Well, it was a[if most of the scavenger hunt goals are achieved]n excellent effort[else] good try[end if], Daniel, but I'm afraid you haven't [if almost all of the scavenger hunt goals are achieved]quite [end if]found everything.  Better luck next time!'[paragraph break]It takes you a few moments to realize that 'the bitter taste of defeat' is, in this case, not a figure of speech: the air literally does taste bitter.";
	otherwise:
		say "Michelle shakes her head.  'None of the items on the list? Better luck next time!'[paragraph break]It takes you a few moments to realize that 'the bitter taste of defeat' is, in this case, not a figure of speech: the air literally does taste bitter.";

When Scavenger Hunting ends (this is the clear the player's inventory of scavenger hunt items rule):
	remove the items list for the Scavenger Hunt from play;
	repeat with treasure running through things which fulfill a scavenger hunt goal:
		if the player has the treasure, remove the treasure from play;

GOAL_SCAVENGER_HUNT is a goal, major, achieved.

A peculiar flavor hanging in the air.[paragraph break]Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.  You could talk to Aidan, but he'd probably just march you straight up to the hospital.

I would have totally missed it if she hadn't pointed it out as we were coming back from dinner earlier.'  You remember feeling a little nauseous as you walked by the info desk.  You thought it might have been something you ate.  'Personally,' Stacy continues, 'I'm kind of wondering if maybe it could be real.  The sounds and stuff you told us about, I mean.'[paragraph break]Ava frowns.  'Stacy, how can it possibly be real?  Nobody else noticed anything.'[paragraph break]'Nobody else noticed Daniel getting all glassy-eyed and green either.  Look, Daniel, there's a very easy way to find out.  If there's something at the info desk that's making you sick, then going there again will bring back the same feeling, right?  So we could just go there and see how consistent these feelings are.'"

	Q_STACY_AVA_5A is a transitional quip. The following quip is Q_STACY_AVA_6. The menu text is "'They're pretty consistent, now I think about it.  Always at the same place... sort of.  I mean, unless something's changed about the place since.'".

Q_STACY_AVA_6 is a transitional quip. The following quip is Q_STACY_AVA_10. The display text is "Ava looks thoughtful.  'It could be some sort of allergy, I suppose.  Maybe we could find out exactly what's causing this, and fix it.'".

Of course we look out for you!'[paragraph break]'The question is,' Stacy says, 'what are we going to do about it?'  You recognize the look on her face: it's the one she gets when she's decided that something needs fixing.  'I think we should see if this is being triggered by anything.  Ava noticed you going all green and glassy-eyed by the info desk after dinner earlier, so maybe we should go back there and see if there's any sort of pattern going on.'"

	Q_STACY_AVA_8A is a transitional quip. The following quip is Q_STACY_AVA_6. The menu text is "'They're pretty consistent, now I think about it.  Always at the same place... sort of.  I mean, unless something's changed about the place since.'".

Q_STACY_AVA_10 is a quip. The display text is "'Okay, then!'  Stacy grins cheerfully as she pulls a deerstalker cap out of her dresser.  'I'd say we have a mystery to solve.'[paragraph break]Ava gets out a notebook and pen.  'Just try to focus, Daniel.  We'll get to the bottom of this.'"

After firing Q_STACY_AVA_10:
	now Stacy Alexander wears a deerstalker cap;

Check going from Stacy's Room when the current conversationalist is Ava: placeholder "The player shouldn't be able to leave until this conversation is over." instead.

The deerstalker cap is a Stacy-esque hat. "Just like the one Sherlock Holmes wears in all those pictures of him!  Of course, he'd only have worn it if he were out in the country, but nothing says 'detective' quite like a deerstalker."  Understand "hat" as a hat.


Part 3 - Trailing Lucian

Trailing Lucian is a scene. Trailing Lucian begins when Stacy-and-Ava Dorm Chat ends. Trailing Lucian ends when the location is Lucian's room.

The emotion trail is a backdrop. "[placeholder]It's here, but you'll really need to focus on it.[end placeholder]".  When play begins, move the emotion trail backdrop to all rooms tainted by something. Understand "taste" or "smell" or "feeling" or "sense" as the emotion trail.

[if Trailing Lucian is happening][fire TRIG_FOCUS_HINT]"

When Trailing Lucian begins:
	now the player can sense the lachrymose trail;
	now Stacy follows the player;
	now Ava follows the player;
	add odd sensations investigate to the current goals, if absent;
	move the emotion trail backdrop to all rooms tainted by something.

A focusing rule for the lachrymose trail when in info desk:
	say "Concentrating on the flavor, you sense an undercurrent of something salty as well, like tears.  You can also tell that this is all definitely part of a trail of some sort, going off to the east and the north. [paragraph break]";

A focusing rule for the lachrymose trail when in the first floor midpoint:
	say "Concentrating on the flavor, you sense an undercurrent of salt tears.  Both sour and salt seem to form a line between the info desk and the stairs going down. [paragraph break]"

Last focusing rule for the lachrymose trail:
	fire TRIG_TRAIL;

TRIG_TRAIL is a trigger.

Rule for firing unfired TRIG_TRAIL when in info desk:
	say "'It's a trail,' you say.  'It runs off that way, outside, and that way, back to the dorms.'[paragraph break]'Well,' says Stacy, 'we can't very well leave the building at this time of the night.  We'd best investigate the other direction.'";

Rule for firing unfired TRIG_TRAIL when in the first floor midpoint:
	say "'It's a trail,' you say.  'It goes down the stairs and back to the info desk.'[paragraph break]'I know we said we'd go look around the info desk,' says Stacy, 'but if this is a trail of some sort, I wonder where it leads.'[paragraph break]Ava shrugs.  'Up to you, Daniel.  Off to the info desk, or down the stairs?'";

Rule for firing unfired TRIG_TRAIL when in pits stairwell:
	say "'It's a trail,' you say.  'It goes up the stairs and that way down the hall.'[paragraph break]'I know we said we'd go look around the info desk,' says Stacy, 'but if this is a trail of some sort, I wonder where it leads.'[paragraph break]'I'm guessing the trail up the stairs goes back to the info desk.'  Ava shrugs.  'Up to you, Daniel.  Off to the info desk, or do we see what's at the end of the hall?'";

Rule for firing TRIG_TRAIL when in pits west:
	say "'Whatever it is, it's strongest around that door.'[paragraph break]Ava and Stacy exchange glances, and before you can stop her, Stacy is knocking on the door.  'We've come this far.  I want to know what's at the end of --'[paragraph break]Stacy quickly shuts up when the door opens a crack, and a rather timid little guy peeks out at you.  He fairly reeks of that mysterious sour-salty air.  And now you think you can hear some sort of twittering in the background, too[if the eggdrop-option has been apparent].  It occurs to you that you remember seeing him up at the egg-drop option yesterday, though he certainly wasn't giving off this... whatever it is... back then[end if].[paragraph break]'Hi,' says Ava, who seems to recognize the guy.  'Lucian, isn't it?  We met yesterday at the sign-ups.  Anyway, these are my friends Daniel and Stacy.  May we come in for a moment?'[paragraph break]Lucian lets the door swing half-open and sighs resignedly.  'Sure, if you want,' he says, retreating back into the room.  The three of you follow him inside.";
	now Lucian's Door is open;
	move the player to Lucian's room;
	now Stacy is in Lucian's room;
	now Ava is in Lucian's room.

When Trailing Lucian ends:
	now Stacy  follows no-one;
	now Ava  follows no-one;

Q_LUCIAN_GRANDMOTHER is an unavailable quip. The display text is "'Yeah.  She died.'  The sour taste in the air is almost overwhelmed by a different, marshy sort of smell, yet you somehow know that the two sensations are somehow related.  Ava is instantly consoling Lucian, and finding all the right words that you can't think of.[paragraph break]'Was she a gardener?' asks Ava.  'That's a beautiful garden she's in.'[paragraph break]'Yeah, yeah she was.  She was an environmentalist.  That's why she....'  Lucian stops.  'Never mind.'".

Section 8 - Peter

Q_LUCIAN_PETER is an unavailable quip. The display text is "Lucian picks up the class photo.  'That's Peter,' he says, pointing to the teacher smiling up from one side of the group.

I don't know how to get it back, I mean, I don't want to go crying to the camp counselors like a little crybaby.'  Lucian sniffles and wipes his sleeve across his nose, then reaches over to the CD player to turn the volume up."

After firing Q_LUCIAN_EARTH_CRYSTAL when Q_LUCIAN_EARTH_CRYSTAL was unfired:
	Stacy plans to fix Lucian in two turns from now;
	if Q_LUCIAN_SONG is unfired, say "'Isn't it loud enough for you already?' asks Stacy pointedly.  'It's not even a very good song!  Ava says it makes her sick.'[paragraph break]Ava turns bright red.  'Only because I had to sing it in my voice lessons over and over again,' she says quickly.[paragraph break][Lucian quips Q_LUCIAN_SONG]".

At the time when Stacy plans to fix Lucian: if Stacy is in the location, say "Stacy pulls you and Ava aside.  'Okay,' she says, 'I think I know how to fix this.  We've got to get that earth crystal away from the bullies and give it back to Lucian here.  Daniel, I think we should let you handle this part.  You can track them from the info desk the same way you tracked Lucian.'"

Part 5 - Reclaiming the Crystal

Crystal quest is a scene. Crystal quest begins when Chatting to Lucian ends. [Crystal Quest ends when the player has the Earth Crystal.]

When Crystal Quest begins: 
	now Hank's door is open unlocked;
	add GOAL_CRYSTAL to the current goals, if absent;
	consider the new goal notification rule.
	
First carry out going from Lucian's room during crystal quest:
	say "[one of]'You guys go ahead,' says Ava as you make for the door, 'I'd better stay here with Lucian.  He looks like he needs someone to talk to.'

'Fine, whatever,' says Stacy, rolling her eyes.[or]Ava stays behind with Lucian as usual.[stopping]";
	now Ava does not follow the player;
	now Lucian does not follow the player;
	now Stacy follows the player.


GOAL_CRYSTAL is a goal. The printed name is "[if the Earth Crystal is not handled]retrieve Lucian's crystal[otherwise]give Lucian back his crystal[end if]".  The win condition is "[if the player can see Lucian and the player has the Earth Crystal][goal achieved]".

Chapter 1 - New trail

Check focusing on a room during Crystal Quest: say "Now that you think about it, there are so many alien sensations swirling around, most of them so faint you're not sure if you're just imagining them.  You really don't know which sensation you really want." instead.

First check focusing on the info desk during Crystal Quest:
	now the player can sense the oily trail;
	now the noun is the oily trail.

The oily trail is an emotional residue. The oily trail taints info desk, the first floor midpoint, first floor rooms east. The description of the oily trail is "Some sort of oily, burnt stench seems to coil about your legs here, and you think you can hear some sort of low-pitched chatter."

Understand "burnt", "stench", "engine oil", "oil", "monkey's chatter", "chatter", "path" as the oily trail.

A focusing rule for the oily trail when in info desk:
	say "[one of]You close your eyes and stand near the door to Calvin Field.  You know Lucian's trail begins just outside this door.  Concentrating on the area in question, you[or]You[stopping] sense the beginning of another trail, one that smells of burnt engine oil and sounds like a monkey's chatter dropped several octaves and sped up.  It traces the same path back towards the dorms to the north. [paragraph break]";

A focusing rule for the oily trail when in first floor midpoint:
	say "That unpleasant smell, and its accompanying sound, seems to trace a path from the info desk to the eastern end of the hallway. [paragraph break]";

A focusing rule for the oily trail when in the first floor rooms east:
	say "You can trace that unpleasant smell, and its accompanying sound, to one of the rooms to the south.  The door is open on an already messy room, and with a shock you realize that you are not sensing that burnt-oil smell with your nose at all: it's just registering in your mind as a smell.  Same goes for the sound of low-pitched chattering. [paragraph break]";

Chapter 2 - Bullies

Section 1 - Initial encounter

Last focusing rule for the oily trail when in the first floor rooms east and TRIG_BULLIES is unfired during Crystal Quest:

Q_HANK_3 is a quip. The display text is "'Yeah.  You came here uninvited, so now you got to give us something.  To compensate us for the distress of having to breathe the same air as you.'  Joe looks at Hank.  'What d'you think?'[paragraph break]'I think I could use a nice laptop computer.'[paragraph break]'Sounds about right.  So what're you waiting for, loser-boy?  Scram!'"

Q_HANK_4 is a quip. The display text is "'I signed up for boxing classes and I need to practice.'  Hank flexes his fists.  'So why don't you make yourself useful and stand where I can reach you for, oh, half an hour or so?'  You backpedal out of the room before either of them decides they're being serious.'"

Q_HANK_5 is a quip. The display text is "You open your mouth to say something phenomenally stupid, but visions of yourself missing out on the rest of the LEAP camp, due to being in traction, stop you.  Hank and Joe snicker, but say nothing further."

Q_HANK_6 is a quip. The display text is "'Yeah?  Possession is nine-tenths of the law, loser-boy.  That means that if we possess it, as we do, then it's 90% ours.  You think your 10% stake is gonna do anything?  Shove off.'"

Section 3 - Timeouts and triggers

[this is an Activity, not an Action]
After terminating conversation with Hank when the location is Hank's Room during Crystal Quest:
	now Hank's door is open;
	try going north;

TRIG_NEED_HELP is a quip.  The display text is "[one of]Stacy frowns and shakes her head.  'I think we need help, Daniel.  Should we call a counselor?'[paragraph break]You shake your head.  'No way.  We'll be called snitches and rats until the day we die.'[or][stopping]"

At the time when Hank ushers you out:
	if the player is in Hank's room:
		say "'Are you still here?' Joe says.  'Get out and go bother somebody else!'  The two bullies hustle you to the door and send you sprawling in the hallway outside.";
		now Hank's door is open;
		try going north;
		say Ava quips TRIG_NEED_HELP.


Section 4 - The Earth Crystal

The Earth Crystal is scenery, in Hank's room. "This is a rather heavy cube of pure crystal, with an image of the earth etched into its interior.  Though it appears clear when you look down at it, it seems to glow slightly violet when you hold it up to the light."  The indefinite article of the Earth Crystal is "Lucian's".

Check examining the earth crystal when the Earth Crystal is in Hank's Room: try taking the Earth Crystal instead.

Instead of doing something when in Hank's room and the Earth Crystal is involved and the Earth Crystal is in Hank's Room:
	say "The bullies snatch the crystal out of your reach, laugh in your face, and hustle you out of the room.";
	now Hank's door is open;
	try going north;

Section 5 - Help from Aidan

Check knocking on Aidan's door when Hank's room is visited during Crystal Quest:
	say "Aidan opens the door.  'Hey, Daniel!  What's up?'  He ushers you into the room and sits down at his desk.  'Sorry if I'm a little distracted.  We just had our first class on old-school text adventures today, and I'm kind of caught up in the homework.  Seriously, this is kind of cool.'  Turning back to his laptop, he begins typing away.";
	now Aidan's door is open;
	move the player to Aidan's room instead.

Aidan's warpath is a scene. Aidan's warpath begins when CT_AIDAN_HELP is fired. Aidan's warpath ends when the number of entries in the warpath of Aidan is 0.

First carry out looking during Aidan's warpath: now Aidan is mentioned. [so I don't get "Aidan is here" right before "Aidan goes east"]

Every turn during Aidan's warpath (this is the Aidan vs The Bullies rule):
	let X be entry 1 of the warpath of Aidan;
	if the location of Aidan is Aidan's room:
		move Aidan to X;
	otherwise:
		let d be the quick best route from the location of Aidan to X;
		try Aidan going d;
	remove entry 1 from the warpath of Aidan;

Aidan has a list of objects called the warpath.

The warpath of Aidan is {first floor rooms west, first floor midpoint, first floor rooms east, Hank's room}.

When Aidan's warpath ends:
	if the location is first floor rooms east or the location is the first floor midpoint:
		say "'Yo, Hank!  Joe!'  Aidan strides into the bullies['] room as if he owned the place[if the location is First Floor Rooms east] and perches on the edge of a desk[end if].  'I hear you've been bothering the younger campers again.'[paragraph break]Hank looks out the door, sees you, and gives you the evil eye.  'So?'[paragraph break]'So I figure you gotta either pay a fine or get yourselves ratted out to the counselors.  Me, I don't like ratting on people, so I figure it's gonna be the fine for you guys[if the location is First Floor Rooms east].'  He picks up the earth crystal.  '[otherwise].  [end if]This will do nicely, especially since I gather you took it from one of the younger campers to begin with.'[paragraph break]'Shove off, Aidan.  Unless you want a mouthful of knuckles.'[paragraph break]Aidan gives a short bark of laughter.  'Dude.  My dad chews out Navy SEALs for a living, remember?  They taught me how to kill jerks like you with a pencil when I was five.'  Catching Hank glaring out the door at you, he adds, 'That's my little brother, in case you're wondering.  Only reason he hasn't whooped your sorry asses to hell and back is because he takes the whole [']only pick on people who can fight back['] thing a lot more seriously than I do.'[paragraph break][if the location is First Floor Rooms east]Joe looks like he's about to call Aidan's bluff, but Aidan stares him down.  The two bullies finally look away, muttering something rude.  [end if]Aidan swaggers out of the room and pulls the door shut behind him.  He grins and passes the earth crystal to you.  'There you go.  Problem solved.  Now, I better get back to Zork.'  He musses up your hair and strolls back to his room.";
	otherwise:
		say "'Hey, Daniel!'  Aidan jogs up to you and holds up the earth crystal, grinning.  'This the crystal thingy you told me about?  Here, problem solved.  Hank and Joe are a couple of pushovers, once you convince them you're tougher than both of them put together.  After camp, I'm asking Dad to enroll you in some martial arts classes or something.  I've already told Hank and Joe you're a black belt.'[paragraph break]'Er, thanks.'[paragraph break]'Anytime, bro.'  Aidan musses up your hair and [if the location is not Aidan's room]strolls back to his room[otherwise]settles back in front of his computer[end if].";
	now the player carries the Earth Crystal;
	move Aidan to Aidan's room;
	now Hank's door is closed locked.

Part 6 - Returning the Crystal

Crystal Quest ends when the player can see Lucian and the player has the Earth Crystal.

When Crystal Quest ends:
	say "Lucian looks up from his desk as you enter the room, and his mouth drops open when he sees the earth crystal in your hands.  'You did it!  You got it back!'  He leaps from his chair and throws his arms around you -- the room glows mauve for an instant, and something stabs in the back of your eye.  You vaguely hear Stacy telling Lucian to take it easy, and you feel Ava's arms catching you as you stumble back, off-balance, from Lucian.[paragraph break]'I don't know if we're any closer to figuring out what's going on,' you say to the girls as you leave Lucian's room.  'I mean, so now I'm some sort of psychic bloodhound?  Why me?'[paragraph break]'It could turn out useful,' says Stacy.  'Just think of the things you could do now!'[paragraph break]Ava doesn't say anything.  She just looks worried.";
	consider the goal assessment rule;
	add GOAL_HELP_LUCIAN to the recently achieved goals, if absent;
	consider the goal-tidying rules;
	remove the Earth Crystal from play;
	now the oily trail taints nothing;
	now the player can sense nothing;
	now Stacy does not follow the player;
	ifndef debug;
	pause the game;

GOAL_HELP_LUCIAN is a major goal, achieved. The printed name of GOAL_HELP_LUCIAN is "helping Lucian retrieve his crystal".


Book 3 - Here Comes The Flood

Part 1 - Scene set-up

Here Comes The Flood is a chapter-length scene.
Here Comes The Flood begins when Lucian's Secret ends.
Here Comes The Flood ends when Lost In The Maelstrom ends.

When Here Comes The Flood begins:
	say "The headaches are now nothing more than a faint but constant pressure in the back of your skull.  The dizzy spells are gone, and in their place is a vague sense of unease.  The last time you felt perfectly normal would have to be shortly before falling asleep last night.[paragraph break]If you concentrate even a little bit, you can conjure up those unreal sensations around everybody you meet.  And you're beginning to notice a definite relationship between what you sense and how everybody feels.  This is definitely some sort of empathic thing that's waking up inside you.  You'll have to discuss this with Ava and Stacy and Aidan later tonight.";
	ifndef debug;
	pause the game;
	enddef debug;
	now the current term day is Day 4;
	now the time of day is 5:08 PM;
	now the right hand status line is "[time of day]";	
	now the chapter number is 3;
	now all options are off-stage;
	say "LEAP, Day 4 (Wednesday) - Dinner[paragraph break]You usually have your meals with Ava and Stacy, but they're in a different time slot for dinner today.  Aidan's with his own friends at the other end of the dining hall, which leaves you alone with your readings for your class on satirical drama.  Hopefully Aristophanes and Moliere will be enough to distract you from the rather unpleasant substances on your plate pretending to be meat and potatoes.";
	now the player carries the readings for Satirical Drama;
	move the player to the Dining Hall;
	now Aidan is in the location;
	add GOAL_DINNER to the current goals;
	Lucian comes to dine with you in two turns from now.

Some readings for Satirical Drama are a thing. The description is "Aristophanes, Rabelais, Moliere... if you didn't find this sort of thing as fascinating as you do, you'd be comatose after the first page." The printed name of some readings for Satirical Drama is "readings for your Satirical Drama class". 

Instead of doing something when Aidan is physically involved:
	if Here Comes The Flood is happening, placeholder "Aidan's away with his friends on the other side of the hall." instead;
	if Saving Lucian from Aidan is happening, say "Aidan barely notices your futile attempts to stop him." instead;
	make no decision.


GOAL_DINNER is a goal. The printed name is "eat dinner in peace". The win condition is "[if Lost In The Maelstrom is happening][goal thwarted]".

Part 2 - Dining Hall

The Dining Hall is east of Calvin Field north. "[if Here Comes The Flood is happening]You are alone at the southeast corner of the room, with a few readings for your satirical drama class.  You can see Aidan somewhere off to the west, eating with his friends.[otherwise if in chapter 10]You are sitting between Ava and Stacy.  Lucian is sitting across from you, half-hidden behind a stack of pancakes.  Aidan is with his friends somewhere off to the west.[otherwise]The dining hall is a large room lined with long tables and chairs.  It is crowded with campers discussing just about everything under the sun."

A plural-named thing called some dining tables and chairs are scenery, in the dining hall.

Your dining table is scenery supporter, in the dining hall.
Your dinner is edible scenery on your dining table.

First carry out examining your dinner (this is the school dinners box quote rule):
	display the boxed quotation
		"Don't eat school dinners, just toss them aside!
		A lot of kids didn't, a lot of kids died!
		The meat is of metal, the spuds are of steel,
		And if they don't kill you, the pudding will!";

The description of your dinner is "Seriously, the food's about the only downside to the LEAP camp.  It looks okay, but there's this sickly sweet aftertaste, like they used fake sugar in everything."

Check eating your dinner: say "You shovel another forkful of your dinner into your mouth and swallow it as quickly as you can.  Unfortunately, you still don't quite manage to escape the aftertaste." instead.

Check smelling your dinner: say "It smells innocent enough, anyway.  But smells can be deceiving." instead.

You try to respond but at that moment you hear a little snicker from somewhere -- no doubt one of the other first-years of Lucian's acquaintance -- and Lucian, absolutely mortified, leaves his tray on the table and makes a break for the dining hall doors.  You try to stand but are knocked back into your seat by a wave of bitterness and a strange, slick feeling that makes your skin crawl.  The headache, which you thought was all but gone, throbs to life and the room seems to whirl into a maelstrom of sound and color and smell and flavor and touch.  You're vaguely aware of Aidan, somewhere off to the west, getting to his feet before he disappears into a complicated flurry of woodwinds."

Q_LUCIAN2_8 is a quip. The display text is "Lucian's eyes light up.  'I knew you were different from the others!'  He goes on about his delight at making a friend, but you can't hear him: you've been nearly bowled out of your seat by a wall of fluttering mauve butterfly wings exploding from Lucian.  You fight to regain your balance, but the explosion of color drives you reeling away from the table.  All around you, colors and sounds and smells and flavors and disconcerting sensations thrilling along your skin all erupt into being, leaving you unable to see what's actually there.  You are vaguely aware of Aidan, somewhere off to the west, getting to his feet before you lose him to a complicated flurry of woodwinds."

Part 4 - Emotional Maelstrom

Chapter 1 - Scene setting

Lost in the Maelstrom is a scene. Lost in the Maelstrom begins when the location is the Maelstrom. Lost in the Maelstrom ends when the x part of the coordinate of the Maelstrom is at least 4.

Chapter 2 - Goals

When Lost in the Maelstrom begins:
	now your dinner is off-stage;
	add GOAL_ESCAPE to the current goals, if absent.

GOAL_ESCAPE is a goal. The printed name is "escape from Lucian's emotions". The win condition is "[if the x part of the coordinate of the Maelstrom is not 1 or the y part of the coordinate of the Maelstrom is not 1][escape from Lucian's emotions]". To say escape from Lucian's emotions:

Chapter 3 - Definitions

Section 1 - Coordinate system

A coordinate is a kind of value. (100, 100) specifies a coordinate with parts x (without leading zeros) and y (without leading zeros).

The maelstrom is a room.
The maelstrom has a coordinate. The coordinate of the maelstrom is (1, 1). 
The maelstrom has a coordinate called the boundary. The boundary of the maelstrom is (4, 4).

Section 2 - Some emotional impressions

Emotional impression is a kind of thing. The emotional impressions are defined by the table of overwhelming emotions.

Chapter 4 - Maze Implementation

Section 1 - Available exits

The Maelstrom has a list of objects called the accessible directions.
The Maelstrom has a list of objects called the blocked directions.

The description of the Maelstrom is "[desc de maelstrom]".
To say desc de maelstrom:
	let the potential directions be the list of orthogonal directions;
	if the x part of the coordinate of the Maelstrom is 1:
		remove east from the potential directions, if present;
	if the y part of the coordinate of the Maelstrom is 1:
		remove south from the potential directions, if present;
	if the x part of the coordinate of the Maelstrom is the x part of the boundary of the Maelstrom:
		remove west from the potential directions, if present;
	if the y part of the coordinate of the Maelstrom is the y part of the boundary of the Maelstrom:
		remove north from the potential directions, if present;
	now the accessible directions of the Maelstrom is the potential directions;
	sort the potential directions in random order;
	remove entry 1 from the potential directions;
	sort the potential directions;
	now the blocked directions of the Maelstrom is the potential directions;
	;
	if the x part of the coordinate of the Maelstrom is 4, stop;
	say "You are lost in a swirl of sensory stimuli. ";
	repeat with D running through the blocked directions of the Maelstrom:
		say "[The D] [short description of the feeling of D]. ";
	say paragraph break;
	say "Somewhere off to the west, above the noise and color and inexplicable smells, you think you hear something -- a low-pitched reed instrument of some kind, possibly an oboe -- calling out to you."

First check going an orthogonal direction in Maelstrom:
	if the noun is not listed in the accessible directions of the Maelstrom:
		say "There's a wall in that direction, isn't there?  You stop before you hurt yourself; there is a brief burst of [one of]low-pitched woodwinds[or]songbird chatter[purely at random] nearby, which is quickly lost in the maelstrom." instead;
	otherwise if the noun is listed in the blocked directions of the Maelstrom:
		say "You take a step in that direction but are almost overwhelmed by the sensations." instead;
	otherwise:
		consider the emotion-setting rule;
		consider the coordinate-updating rule;
		move the player to the Maelstrom instead; [illusion of true movement]

Section 2 - Exits have an impression

Emotionally-impressing relates one emotional impression (called the feeling) to one direction. The verb to feel (he feels, they feel) implies the reversed emotionally-impressing relation.

When play begins:
	consider the emotion-setting rule;

This is the emotion-setting rule:
	let the emotions be the list of emotional impressions;
	let the ways be the list of orthogonal directions;
	sort the emotions in random order;
	repeat with i running from 1 to 4:
		now entry i of the ways feels entry i of the emotions;

Definition: a direction is maelstrom-blocked if it is listed in the blocked directions of the Maelstrom.

Definition: a direction is maelstrom-accessible if it is listed in the accessible directions of the Maelstrom.

Understand "[something related by reversed emotionally-impressing]" as a direction when the location is the Maelstrom and the item described is maelstrom-blocked.

Check facing a planar direction (called d) when in the Maelstrom:
[	carry out the printing the description activity with the noun instead.

Rule for printing the description of a direction (called d) when in the maelstrom:]
	if d is a maelstrom-blocked direction, carry out the printing the description activity with the feeling of d instead;
	if d is a maelstrom-accessible direction, placeholder "You sense nothing significant in that direction." instead;
	if d is an orthogonal direction, placeholder "There's a wall in that direction, isn't there?" instead;
	if d is a planar direction, placeholder "You sense nothing significant in that direction." instead.


Section 3 - Movement

This is the coordinate-updating rule:
	let XX be the x part of the coordinate of the Maelstrom;
	let YY be the y part of the coordinate of the Maelstrom;
	if the noun is:
		-- north: increase YY by 1;
		-- south: decrease YY by 1;
		-- west: increase XX by 1;
		-- east: decrease XX by 1;
	now the coordinate of the Maelstrom is the coordinate with x part XX y part YY;

Chapter 5 - End

When Lost In The Maelstrom ends:
	say "You finally stumble into the edge of what looks like a long, sustained note played on an oboe and sounds like a cone of bright, white light.  It leaps about you, and you feel someone catch hold of you -- it takes you a moment to realize that this is real, and not a product of your out-of-control senses.  It's Aidan.  You can hear his voice over the buzzing of all the other sounds that aren't really there.  The relief is overwhelming, and you finally allow yourself to collapse.";
	consider the goal assessment rule;
	say "Just as you lose consciousness, you are startled by the appearance of something ominously black and alien, spinning about in the centre of the whiteness surrounding you....";
	ifndef debug;
	pause the game;
	enddef debug.

Book 4 - Hospital

Hospital is a chapter-length scene. Hospital begins when Here Comes The Flood ends.

When Hospital begins:
	say "The first thing you try to do when you regain consciousness is open your eyes.  This fails because they're already open.  You're in absolute darkness, and there's this smell -- not that you can really trust your senses anymore -- like disinfectant.[paragraph break]Rather more alarmingly, for some odd reason, is the fact that you feel perfectly fine.  When was the last time you felt that way?";
	ifndef debug;
	pause the game;
	enddef debug;
	now the chapter number is 4;
	now the current term day is Day 5;
	now the left hand status line is "Day ??: ??";
	now the right hand status line is "??:??";
	say "[paragraph break]Location unknown, Day unknown - Time un-- you know it's entirely possible that you're dead, right?[paragraph break]You are in darkness.";
	move the player to the coffin case, without printing a room description;
	now everything carried by the player is off-stage;
	add GOAL_FIND_OUT_ABOUT_YOU to the current goals, if absent.

GOAL_FIND_OUT_ABOUT_YOU is a goal. The printed name is "find out what's happened to you".  The win condition is "[if Doc Rose Chat has ended][goal achieved]".

Rule for printing the announcement of darkness when in the coffin case: do nothing.

your hospital room is a room. "[if in chapter 9]The room is, if anything, even more full of medical equipment than the last time you were here.  Aidan has been strapped into that coffin-thing that you woke up in back then, and trussed up so securely that it's a wonder they found anywhere to stick the wires monitoring his condition.  The door is back to the north.

A pair of comfortable chairs have been wheeled in, along with a small table.  Dr Rose [Claudia Rose mentioned]sits in one chair, watching you with concern.[otherwise]You are in a hospital room, equipped with a single bizarre-looking coffin-case thing attached to a bewildering wall of medical equipment.  The walls are painted a sterile white.  Huge windows look out to the south, while a pale green door, equipped with a small viewing window, is to the north." 

The huge window is scenery in your hospital room. "You can see your dorm from here!"  Check facing south when in your hospital room: say the initial appearance of the huge window instead. Understand "windows" as the huge window when in your hospital room. Check searching the huge window: say the initial appearance of the huge window instead.  Jacobs Hall is in your hospital room.

The viewing window is scenery in your hospital room. "It's a square of reinforced glass set into the middle of the door.  Through it, you can see a featureless hospital corridor." Check facing north when in your hospital room: say the initial appearance of the viewing window instead. Check searching the viewing window: say the initial appearance of the viewing window instead. 

your hospital room door is a closed door, scenery. The description is "[if in your hospital room]It's metal and looks very heavy and solid.[otherwise]You can see your hospital room through the door's viewing window.".  your hospital room door is north of your hospital room and south of the south T-intersection. 

The medical equipment is scenery in your hospital room. "Monitors, wires, computers ... it's all quite dizzying and bewildering.  Is that a stereo amplifier?" First check switching on the medical equipment: say "You don't know what it does -- or does to you -- and since you had your head in it, you think it best not to fiddle with it." First check switching off the medical equipment: say "Saving energy is always a virtue, but perhaps medical stuff could be allowed an exception."

Check listening to the medical equipment: say "They hum and beep just like the medical equipment you've seen on TV, though these things here look nothing like the medical equipment you've seen on TV." instead.
Check listening to when in the coffin case and the coffin case is closed: say "You think you can hear some sort of electronic hum, but otherwise it's pretty quiet." instead.
Check listening to when in your hospital room: say "You hear the steady hum of medical equipment." instead.

Part 1 - Inside the Coffin

The coffin case is scenery, an enterable, openable, closed, container in your hospital room. The description is "It's shiny and silver and futuristic-looking, but still looks like a coffin.  Or an Egyptian sarcophagus.  Or an iron maiden.  You'd have to be out cold before you'd let anyone put you into that thing."  Understand "coffin-case", "cranial" or "crown" or "helmet" or "contraption" as the coffin case. Understand "machine" or "device" as the coffin case when the coffin case is in the location.

Cased In is a scene.
Cased In begins when Hospital begins. [the player is in the coffin case.]
Cased In ends eventually when the time since Cased In began is 10 minutes.
Cased In ends prematurely when the coffin case is open.

Check shouting at the location during Cased In: now the coffin case is open instead.
First check knocking on during Cased In: now the coffin case is open instead.
Check focusing on during Cased In: say "You feel solid walls on every side of you, pressing close.  It feels like a coffin, with walls cold and impersonal." instead.
Check touching during Cased In: say "You feel solid walls on every side of you, pressing close.  It feels like a coffin, with walls cold and impersonal." instead.
Check opening during Cased In: say "You can't feel any door.  Or knob.  Or switch." instead.

Every turn during Cased In:
	if cased in is happening for the fourth time and the coffin case is closed, say "Is the air getting a little warm in here? Like, a little stale?";
	if cased in is happening for the eighth time and the coffin case is closed, say "The word 'oxygen' keeping beating inside your brain, and you're sure the air is warm in here."

Instead of conversing when in the coffin case and the coffin case is closed, say "You speak a few timid words, but something in front of you is bouncing the sounds back at you."


When Cased In ends:
	now the left hand status line is "Day ??: [the location in title case]";
	now the coffin case is open;
	say "The darkness above you flies open, and you're momentarily blinded by a flood of bright light.  As you try to blink away the spots, a face swims into view -- it takes you a few moments to register the curly white hair, the rosy cheeks and the clear blue eyes, and the fact that said face is talking to you.";
	[move the player to your hospital room, without printing a room description;]
	start conversation with Doctor Claudia Rose on Q_DOC_ROSE_0.

Check entering the coffin case when not in the coffin case: say "No." instead.

Check attacking the coffin case: say "However creepy that thing might be, trying to destroy it strikes you as being a very bad idea.  Dr Rose might think you need to start over in a new one." instead.

Check exiting from the coffin case when Doctor Rose is in the location: say "'Not just yet, Daniel,' Dr Rose says gently, 'you've just had a tremendous shock to your system, and you should rest a little longer.'" instead.
Report exiting from the coffin case when Doctor Rose is not in the location: say "'Daniel, you should be resting, like Dr Rose said!'

'I'll feel better once I'm out of this coffin,' you retort as you clamber out of it.  And not a moment too soon." instead.



Part 2 - Conversation with Doctor Claudia Rose

Chapter 1 - Doctor Rose

Doc Rose Chat is a scene. Doc Rose Chat begins when Cased In ends. Doc Rose chat ends when Q_DOC_ROSE_14 is fired.

It will flood your brain with an electromagnetic frequency that should dampen the new sensory stimulus going to your brain, giving it a rest and allowing it to recuperate enough so it doesn't go out of control again.

Part 4 - Hospital Map

The Valmont Hospital region is a region. 

A hospital corridor is a kind of room. Every hospital corridor is in the Valmont Hospital region.
A hospital ward is a kind of room. Every hospital ward is in the Valmont Hospital region.
Ward R15 is a hospital ward. 
Your hospital room is in the Valmont Hospital region.

[ A hospital door is a kind of door. A viewing window is a kind of thing.
A viewing window is part of every hospital door.

Check searching a hospital door (called the portal):
	redirect the action from the portal to a random viewing window which is part of the portal, and try that instead; ]

South T-intersection is a hospital corridor[, north of your hospital room]. "You are in a featureless hospital corridor stretching from east to west.  Another corridor goes off to the north.  The door to your hospital room is to the south."

Southwest Corner of hospital is a hospital corridor, west of South T-intersection.  "The corridor makes a bend here, going east and north.  There are hospital rooms, apparently empty, to the west and south."

Southeast Corner of hospital is a hospital corridor, east of South T-intersection. "The corridor makes a bend here, going west and north.  There are hospital rooms, apparently empty, to the east and south."

west T-intersection is a hospital corridor, north of Southwest Corner of hospital . "You are in a featureless hospital corridor stretching north and south.  Another corridor goes off to the east.  A door marked 'EXIT' is to the west."

The west T-intersection door is a locked door. "Through a narrow window in the door, you can catch a glimpse of the fire escape stairs."  It is west of the west T-intersection. Check opening the west T-intersection door: say "Probably not a good idea: it looks like there's some kind of alarm set to go off when you open it." instead.

The main intersection is a hospital corridor, east of west T-intersection, north of South T-intersection. "This is the heart of this particular wing of the hospital, with corridors running off in all four cardinal directions."

east T-intersection is a hospital corridor, east of the main intersection, north of Southeast corner of hospital . "You are in a featureless hospital corridor stretching north and south.  Another corridor goes off to the west.  A pair of elevator doors are set into the east wall."

The elevator doors are scenery in east T-intersection. "They look pretty imposing.  There's no reason to go through them, though, not at the moment."

Northwest Corner  of hospital  is a hospital corridor, north of west T-intersection.  "The corridor makes a bend here, going east and south.  There are hospital rooms to the west and north, although the sounds coming from the north suggest that that particular hospital room is not quite as empty as all the others have been."

North T-intersection is a hospital corridor, east of Northwest Corner of hospital , north of main intersection.  "You are in a featureless hospital corridor stretching north and south.  Another corridor goes off to the south."

Northeast Corner  of hospital is a hospital corridor, east of North T-intersection, north of east T-intersection.  "The corridor makes a bend here, going west and south.  There are hospital rooms, apparently empty, to the east and north."

Ward-F is a hospital ward, west of Southwest Corner.
Ward-G is a hospital ward, east of Southeast Corner.
Ward-H is a hospital ward, south of Southwest Corner.
Ward-I is a hospital ward, south of Southeast Corner.

Check facing towards a hospital ward:
	say "A glance through the viewing windows shows that the rooms beyond are quite unoccupied." instead.

Understand "door", "doors", "viewing window", "view", "window" as a direction when the item described is headed towards a hospital ward.

After printing the name of a direction that is headed towards a hospital ward:
	say " door".

Check searching a direction that is headed towards a hospital ward: try facing the noun instead.

Part 5 - Wandering (Dis)Orderly

Wandering Disorderly is a scene. Wandering Disorderly begins when Hospital Chat ends.

When wandering disorderly begins:
	now Ava follows the player;
	now Stacy follows the player.

The wandering orderly is a person. The wandering orderly is in North T-intersection.
The wandering orderly can be stopped. The wandering orderly is not stopped.
The wandering orderly can be wandering-freely or capturing. The wandering orderly is wandering-freely.
The wandering orderly has a room called the previous location. The previous location of the wandering orderly is North T-intersection.

Every turn during Wandering Disorderly:
	abide by the disorderly decision rules;
	consider the disorderly movement rules.

The disorderly decision rules are a rulebook.

A disorderly decision rule when the wandering orderly was stopped:
	now the wandering orderly is not stopped instead;

A disorderly decision rule when the wandering orderly is stopped: rule fails.

A disorderly decision rule when the wandering orderly is in a hospital ward:
	if a random chance of 3 in 8 succeeds:
		unless the location of the wandering orderly is adjacent:
			rule fails.

The disorderly movement rules are a rulebook.

First disorderly movement rule when the wandering orderly is in an adjacent room and the wandering orderly is capturing (this is the wandering orderly capture rule):
	let x be the location of the wandering orderly;
	let d be the quick best route from x to the location of the player;
	now the previous location of the wandering orderly is x;
	try the wandering orderly trying going d;
	rule fails;

A disorderly movement rule (this is the disorderly wandering rule):
	now the wandering orderly is wandering-freely;
	let the proposed directions be { north, south, east, west };
	sort the proposed directions in random order;
	repeat with dir running through the proposed directions:
		let x be the room dir from the location of the wandering orderly;
		if x is a room:
			let the new direction be the direction produced by the disorderly motion rules for x;
			if the new direction is a direction:
				now the previous location of the wandering orderly is the location of the wandering orderly;
				try the wandering orderly trying going the new direction;
				rule succeeds;

The disorderly motion rules are an object based rulebook producing a direction.
A disorderly motion rule for the Northwest Corner of hospital: rule fails.
A disorderly motion rule for your hospital room: rule fails.

A disorderly motion rule for a room (called r) when the wandering orderly is in a Hospital Ward and r is not the location:
	rule succeeds with result the quick best route from the location of the wandering orderly to r;

A disorderly motion rule for a room (called r) when r is not the location:
	if r is not the previous location of the wandering orderly:
		rule succeeds with result the quick best route from the location of the wandering orderly to r;


First report the wandering orderly trying going to an adjacent hospital corridor (called R) from a room that is not the location:
	now the wandering orderly is capturing;
	say "You notice an orderly pushing a gurney out into the corridor, off to the [quick best route from the location to R].  It looks like he's about to head this way!" instead.

First report the wandering orderly trying going:
	if the room gone to is the location:
		placeholder "A gurney is pushed right into you by an orderly who, though surprised, is not too surprised to immediately sound the alarm.  Within seconds, Ava and Stacy have been bundled out of the hospital and you're locked into your room.  It's a couple of hours before Dr Rose comes back, frowning in a very concerned manner.";
		fire TRIG_DR_ROSE_DEATH;

First report going to a hospital corridor:
	if the room gone to contains the capturing wandering orderly:
		placeholder "You run right into an orderly who, though surprised, is not too surprised to immediately sound the alarm.  Within seconds, Ava and Stacy have been bundled out of the hospital and you're locked into your room.  It's a couple of hours before Dr Rose comes back, frowning in a very concerned manner.";
		fire TRIG_DR_ROSE_DEATH;
	otherwise if the room gone to contains the wandering orderly:
		consider the disorderly wandering rule;
	continue the action.

Check going to a hospital ward:
	if the room gone to contains the wandering orderly:
		say "You open the door and run right into an orderly who, though surprised, is not too surprised to immediately sound the alarm.  Within seconds, Ava and Stacy have been bundled out of the hospital and you're locked into your room.  It's a couple of hours before Dr Rose comes back, frowning in a very concerned manner.";
		fire TRIG_DR_ROSE_DEATH;
	otherwise if the wandering orderly is in an adjacent room (called R):
		let x be a random adjacent hospital corridor;
		while x is the location of the wandering orderly:
			now x is a random adjacent hospital corridor;
		let d be the quick best route from the location to x;
		move the wandering orderly to x;
		now the previous location of the wandering orderly is the location;
		now the wandering orderly is stopped;
		now the wandering orderly is wandering-freely;
		say "You quickly duck into the empty hospital room as an orderly [if R is a Hospital Ward]comes out of the other room[otherwise]approaches[end if].  You wait until the footsteps fade away to [the d] before emerging again into the corridor.";
	otherwise:
		say "You quickly duck into the empty hospital room.  After a few moments, when nothing happens, you creep back out again.";
	rule succeeds.

TRIG_DR_ROSE_DEATH is a quip. The display text is "'I do wish you wouldn't insist on running around unsupervised, Daniel.  You need your rest, we need to monitor your condition, and this last adventure of yours might very possibly have interfered terribly with ... well, with everything.  The data may have been compromised.  I'm afraid we'll have to keep you under observation a little longer.'  She shakes her head sadly. 'Believe me, Daniel, I'd have liked to let you go back to the camp every bit as much as you would, but under the circumstances, I'm afraid it just can't be done.'"

After firing TRIG_DR_ROSE_DEATH: end the story saying "The story is over."


Part 6 - Finding Aidan

Outward Journey is a scene. Outward Journey begins when Hospital Chat ends. Outward Journey ends when TRIG_FOUND_AIDAN is fired.

Return Journey is a scene. Return Journey begins when Outward Journey ends. Return Journey ends when the location is your hospital room. Wandering Disorderly ends when Return Journey ends.

When Outward Journey begins:
	now Stacy follows the player;
	now Ava follows the player;
	move the player to South T-Intersection.

Last report going to the northwest corner of hospital when TRIG_FOUND_R15 is unfired during Outward Journey: say Ava quips TRIG_FOUND_R15.

TRIG_FOUND_R15 is a quip.  The display text is "'Here we are,' whispers Ava, pointing to a door to the north.  'That's room R15.  Aidan's in there.'"

The room R15 door is a door, north of Northwest Corner, south of ward R15.  The printed name of the room R15 door is "door to R15".  Understand "window", "viewing window", "view", "ward" as the room R15 door when the room R15 door is in the location. Understand "R15" or "room 15" or "room r15" as the room R15 door when hospital chat is happening [just as a conversation Object]. 

Check searching the room R15 door: try going the room R15 door instead.
Check opening the room R15 door: fire TRIG_FOUND_AIDAN instead.
Check facing north when in the northwest corner: fire TRIG_FOUND_AIDAN instead.

TRIG_FOUND_AIDAN is a trigger. 
	
Rule for firing TRIG_FOUND_AIDAN:
	if TRIG_FOUND_AIDAN is unfired:
		say "Looking through the window, you see a room equipped in much the same way your room was, complete with the silvery, high-tech coffin thing.  That's where the resemblance ends.  The lid of the coffin thing has been broken off and lies at the far end of the room, a huge crack down its middle, and smoke billows out from one broken monitor.  Aidan himself is lying near the coffin, unconscious, while a bunch of orderlies stand at a very safe distance away from him.[paragraph break]Fear, shock, whatever, it's thick in the air and feels like you just snorted hot salsa up your nose.[paragraph break]In the middle of all this is Dr Rose.  You can't hear what she's saying but ... oh, well, it looks like she's done lecturing the orderlies and now she's heading for the door.  You pull back before she sees you.  You've got to get back to your room before she notices you're gone, but you're in a corner and there's no way to know which way she'll turn when she comes out, and if you hide in the empty room to the west Dr Rose will almost certainly get to your room before you.[paragraph break]'Go that way,' Stacy whispers, shoving you eastwards.  'I'll distract them.'  Before you can say anything, Stacy has run off to the south.";
		now Stacy does not follow the player;
		try silently Stacy going south;
	otherwise:
		say "'Daniel Wayne!' Dr Rose catches you by the collar and frowns, clearly disappointed.  'What are you doing out of your room?  Come on, back you go.'  She marches you back to your room, where she proceeds to put you through a battery of seemingly unnecessary tests.  Pursing her lips as she reads the data scrolling by on the monitors, she says, [run paragraph on]";
		fire TRIG_DR_ROSE_DEATH.


When Return Journey ends: now Ava does not follow the player.

Hospital ends when Return Journey ends.

When Hospital ends:
	say "And not a moment too soon.  When Dr Rose comes bustling in, you are back in the coffin thing and Ava is sitting beside you, looking as if you'd just spent the past half hour talking about the weather.  Dr Rose frowns a bit when she checks the readouts on the various monitors, but no-one can look as innocent as Ava when she has to, and in the end Dr Rose decides that nothing suspicious has been going on after all.[paragraph break]Aidan, she says, is still undergoing observation of some kind, but you're free to go back to camp.  Brad picks you up after lunch (it turns out that the hospital food tastes just as nasty as the camp food) and you're back in time for your afternoon classes.  It's dinner time before Aidan is back at camp; and whatever it was that happened to him in the hospital, he either doesn't remember, or doesn't want to tell you.";
	ifndef debug;
	pause the game;
	enddef debug.



Book 5 - Robotics Class

Robot Fun is a chapter-length scene. 
Robot Fun begins when Hospital ends.
Robot Fun begins when chapter number is 5 [and the player is in the robotics class]. [isn't set to 5 until it's own Begin rule, but testers can force it.]

When Robot Fun begins:
	now every logic block is on your workbench;
	now the current term day is day 6;
	now the time of day is 10:25 AM;
	now the left hand status line is "[Current term day]: [the location in title case]";
	now the right hand status line is "[time of day]";
	now the chapter number is 5;
	say "Things settle down, more or less, over the next day or so.  People are trying very hard to not give you funny looks when they see you, which pretty much comes to the same thing, really.  Aidan's probably going through the same sort of thing too.  He's certainly rather a bit more moody than he used to be.[paragraph break]LEAP, Day 6 (Friday) - Class Period 2[paragraph break]Robotics class, the wave of the future, because everyone knows that some day we're going to have giant killer robots laying waste to downtown Tokyo or something like that, and it would be a good thing to know how to deal with them.  No-one's really capable of making a giant killer robot: right now, you're all just doing a basic project to program a robot to do a certain simple task.  Except Stacy, who seems to be dead set on making a midget killer robot she calls the 'Stacy Alexander Robot Guy', or SARG for short.";
	add GOAL_MR_ROBOTO to the recently achieved goals, if absent;
	move Stacy Alexander to Robotics Class;
	move Aidan to Robotics Class;
	move the player to Robotics Class;
	move Antonia Long to Robotics Class;
	remove Ava from play;
	now nobody follows the player.

GOAL_MR_ROBOTO is a goal. The printed name is "get your robot to move marbles on its own".  The win condition is "[if Robot Fun has ended][goal achieved]". Understand "help" as GOAL_MR_ROBOTO when in chapter 5.

Robotics Class is a privately-named unimportant classroom. "[if in chapter 5]You sit at a table in a perfectly ordinary classroom, surrounded by electronic parts.  [Antonia mentioned]Antonia Long, your Robotics instructor, has been cornered elsewhere by students with issues, leaving you to your own electronic, robotic devices.  Stacy sits beside you with her own robot project, SARG, while Aidan[Aidan mentioned] is at another table with the older students[otherwise]No windows here:  small electronic and mechanical parts fill every nook and cranny of the shelved walls of Robotics.  A half-dozen tables each large enough for four march down the center of the room toward Instructor Long's bench, opposite the door[end if]." Understand "robotics" as Robotics Class.

Some electronic parts are scenery in robotics class. "[if in chapter 5]You've already isolated the bits and pieces you need; the rest is[otherwise]They are[end if] just so much debris."

Check going somewhere when in chapter 5: placeholder "You can't leave class until you finish building your robot's brain." instead.

Understand "build" or "build [text]" or "make" or "make [text]" as a mistake ("To do that, you must insert all of the logic blocks into all of the robot's slots, into their right order, so the robot will be able to move the marbles from one basket to the other.") when in chapter 5.

Your workbench is a scenery supporter in robotics class. "Sturdy enough to hold a robot army.  Which is good, as Stacy looks like she's building one."




Part 1 - The Robot and its brain slots

Your robot is a fixed in place animal on your workbench. The description is "[program description]". Understand "slots" or "brain" or "your" as your robot.


Part 2 - Logic Blocks

A logic block is a kind of thing, improper-named. Some logic blocks[ in Robotics Class] are defined by the table of robot logic blocks.  Understand "programming", "logic block", "code", "block", "brain block", "blocks" as a logic block.  Definition: a logic block is placed rather than unplaced if it is in a slot.

The description of a logic block is usually "[The item described] is labeled with the program logic it contains, in pseudo-code form. This one reads:[paragraph break][fixed letter spacing][pseudocode of the item described][variable letter spacing]".

Before listing contents: group logic blocks together.
After printing the name of a logic block while not grouping together: say " logic block".
Before grouping together logic blocks: say "some programming logic blocks, all different colors: "

[Understand "blocks" as the block-collective. The block-collective is a privately-named undescribed scenery thing in robotics class. Instead of doing something other than examining the block-collective, say "You'll have to pick a specific block."] [Check examining [the block-collective]: say "The blocks on the table are:[line break]"; repeat with X running through the logic blocks on your  workbench begin; say "[The X]:[line break][fixed letter spacing][pseudocode of X][variable letter spacing][line break]"; end repeat. ]

Understand "examine [logic blocks]" or "x [logic blocks]" as examining.

To say tab: say "    ".

Understand "copper", "copper-colored" as the copper-colored.
Understand "red" as the scarlet.
Understand "orange" as the saffron.
Understand "gold", "yellow" as the golden.


Part 3 - slots 

A slot is a kind of container. Some slots are defined by the table of programming slots. After printing the name of a plugged slot (called the spot) while asking which do you mean: say " (with [a random logic block in the spot])". Every slot is part of your robot.  Definition: a slot is plugged rather than unplugged if it contains a logic block. 

Does the player mean inserting a unplaced block into an unplugged slot: it is very likely. 
Does the player mean inserting a placed block into an unplugged slot: it is likely.  
Does the player mean removing a placed block from: it is likely.

The brace count and the loop count are numbers that vary. 
[To say braces (n - a number): now the brace count is the brace count plus n; if the brace count < 1, say "A yellow light blinks slowly on slot [The currently processing slot].  ".]

To say loop (n - a number): increase the loop count by n. 

The basket faced is a container that varies. The basket faced is usually the metal bowl.

Holding_marble, last_used are truth states that vary. 

A metal bowl and a wicker basket are containers on your workbench. A marble is a kind of thing. 7 marbles are in the wicker basket. 

The currently executing slot is a number that varies.

To check brace syntax:  if the brace count is less than zero, say "A yellow light beside slot [the currently executing slot] blinks."

To check loop syntax: if the loop count is less than zero, say "A yellow light beside slot [the currently executing slot] blinks slowly.  "

Chapter 2 - rulebook 

The robot action rules are an object-based rulebook.

First robot action of something (called X):
	now the currently executing slot is the position of X.

Robot action for copper-colored: 
	say "The robot nods to itself, as if it just told itself something it needs to remember.  "; 
	decrease brace count by 1;
	check brace syntax;
	
Robot action for royal purple:  
	say "The robot's left hand grabs ";
	if a marble is in the basket faced:
		let that marble be a random marble in the basket faced;
		now your robot carries that marble;
		say "a marble from [the basket faced].  ";
	otherwise:
		say "thin air, as there aren't any marbles in [the basket faced].  ".

Robot action for hot pink: 
	decrease brace count by 1;
	check brace syntax;
	say "The robot seems to sigh, as if its doing something its getting bored of.  ".

Robot action for scarlet:  
	decrease the brace count by 1;
	check brace syntax;
	say "The robot tilts its head to the left.  "

Robot action for saffron: 
	now the basket faced is the metal bowl;
	say "The robot turns to face the metal bowl.  It tilts its head to the left.  ";
	increase brace count by 1;
	check brace syntax;
	say "And to the right. It then grabs ";
	if a marble is in the basket faced:
		let that marble be a random marble in the basket faced;
		now your robot carries that marble;
		say "a marble";
	otherwise:
		say "thin air, as there aren't any marbles in [the basket faced].  "

Robot action for golden: 
	decrease brace count by 1;
	check brace syntax;
	now the basket faced is the wicker basket;
	say "The robot turns to face the wicker basket[if the wicker basket contains at least 10 marbles] full of marbles[end if].  "

Robot action for mint green:	
	say "The robot does an exaggerated sigh, and looks down at [the basket faced].  ";
	increase brace count by 2;
	check brace syntax;

Robot action for  magenta:
	say "The robot tilts its head back, as if trying to remember something.  ";
	increase the brace count by 1;
	check brace syntax;
	if your robot has a marble:
		now every marble carried by your robot is in the basket faced;
		say "Then it drops the marble into [the basket faced].  ";
	otherwise:
		say "It opens its hand, to no effect.  "

Robot action for  baby blue: 
	say "The robot deliberately nods, as if to reaffirm something in its mind.  It then turns toward the metal bowl.  ";
	now the basket faced is the metal bowl.

Robot action for  forest green:
	say "The robot deliberately nods to itself, as if to say, 'ok.'  It then tilts its head to the left.  "


Part 5 - Action on slots and logic blocks

First check inserting a logic block which is not held into (this is the implicit take to enslot rule): try silently taking the noun; unless the player carries the noun, say "Wait, where did [the noun] go?" instead.

Check inserting a logic block into your robot: 
	repeat with N running from 1 to 10:
		repeat with X running through the slots:
			if the running order of X is N:
				if X is unplugged, try inserting the noun into X instead;
				otherwise break; [out of the inner loop]
	say "There's no open slots." instead.

Check inserting something into a slot when the noun is not a logic block:
	say "The slots are designed to each hold one logic block[if the second noun is plugged]. Besides, that one already has [a random logic block in the second noun] in it[end if]." instead.

Check inserting something into a plugged slot (called the occupied slot): say "But that slot already has the [random something in the occupied slot] in it." instead.

Report inserting something into a slot: say "Ker-chunk[one of]! [The noun] fills the slot snugly.[or]. Another block fits neatly into place.[or]. You put [the noun] in the slot.[or].[or].[or] - isn't this fun?[or].[stopping]" instead.

Instead of doing something except inserting or swapping when an unplugged slot is physically involved, say "Nothing's in that slot."

[Before doing something except taking or removing when the noun is a plugged slot and a plugged slot is physically involved: let B be a random logic block in the noun; now the noun is B.]

Check taking a plugged slot: let B be a random logic block in the noun; try taking B instead.

First check removing a placed block from your robot: now the second noun is the holder of the noun.
First check removing a placed block from the program: now the second noun is the holder of the noun.

Check removing a plugged slot from: let X be a random logic block in the noun; try removing X from the second noun instead.

Check taking a placed block during robot fun:
	now the player carries the noun;
	say "You unplug [the noun] from your robot." instead.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while in chapter 5: now the noun is your robot.

Every turn when in chapter 5: now every logic block in [on the floor of] robotics class is on your workbench.

Part 6 - The program

The program is part of your robot. The description is "[program description]".  Understand "mind" as the program.

To say program description:
	if every slot is not plugged:
		say "All the program slots are empty.  Your robot has no brain. ";
		stop;
	say "Going down the list of slots, your program reads as follows:[line break][line break]";
	let B be an object;
	repeat with X running from 1 to 10:
		if a logic block (called Blk) is in position X, now B is Blk;
		otherwise now B is nothing;
		if we are examining your robot, say "[if B is nothing]Slot [X] is empty.[otherwise]In slot [X], [the B]:[line break]";
		unless B is nothing, say "[fixed letter spacing][pseudocode of B][variable letter spacing][line break]".

Understand "run [program]", "execute [program]", "run [your robot]", "execute [your robot]" or "turn on [program]" or "turn on [your robot]" as entering. Understand "run", "go", "execute" as entering when in chapter 5. Rule for supplying a missing noun when entering and in chapter 5: now the noun is the program.

First check entering your robot (this is the by robot i meant program rule): now the noun is the program. [no instead -- typecasting]

The number of correctly placed blocks is a number that varies. The number of correctly placed blocks is usually 0.

Check entering the program when in chapter 5 (this is the domo arigato mr roboto rule):
	now holding_marble is false;
	now last_used is false;
	now the number of correctly placed blocks is 0;
	repeat with X running from 1 to 10:
		unless a logic block (called B) is in position X, say "Finally, it stops moving, a red light blinking on slot [X]." instead;
		say "[bracket][printed name of B][close bracket] ";
		consider the robot action rules for B;
		if B is the solution block corresponding to a running order of X in the table of programming slots, increase the number of correctly placed blocks by one;
	say paragraph break;
	if the number of correctly placed blocks is ten, rule succeeds;
	rule fails.

[Instead of entering the program when in chapter 5:
	if a slot is not plugged, say "That can't be right. You need every single one of these blocks." instead;
	if the braces are not matched, say "Your robot buzzes and whirrs sadly[one of]. Stacy peers over. 'That's no good,' she says, and points at the { and } squiggly lines in your program. 'Your braces don't match. Every opening brace needs a closing one.'[or].[or][if a random chance of 1 in 4 succeeds]. 'Braces!' calls Stacy helpfully.[otherwise].[end if][stopping]" instead;
	if the loop is not matched, say "¿Bad loop?" instead;
	rule succeeds.]

Part 8 - helper routines

To decide which number is the position of (b - a logic block):
	if b is in a slot (called the holster), decide on the running order of the holster;
	otherwise decide on -1.

[To decide which list of objects is the current program:
	let zblocks be a list of objects;
	repeat with i running from 1 to 10:
		if a logic block (called B) is in position i:
			add B to zblocks;
	decide on zblocks.
]
Block-ordering relates a logic block (called X) to a number (called Y) when the position of X is Y. The verb to be in position implies the block-ordering relation.

[
To decide whether braces are not matched:
	now the brace count is 0;
	repeat with B running through the current program:
		let the temporary adjustment be 0;
		increment the brace count by the braces of B; 
		if B is:
			-- scarlet: change the temporary adjustment to -1;
			-- saffron: change the temporary adjustment to -1;
			-- forest green: change the temporary adjustment to -1;
		increment the brace count by the temporary adjustment;
		if the brace count is less than 0:
			decide yes;
		decrement the brace count by the temporary adjustment;
	decide on whether or not the brace count is not 0.

To decide whether loop is not matched:
	now the brace count is 0;
	repeat with B running through the current program:
		let the temporary adjustment be 0;
		increment the brace count by the braces of B; 
		if B is:
			-- scarlet: change the temporary adjustment to -1;
			-- saffron: change the temporary adjustment to -1;
			-- forest green: change the temporary adjustment to -1;
		increment the brace count by the temporary adjustment;
		if the brace count is less than 0:
			decide yes;
		decrement the brace count by the temporary adjustment;
	decide on whether or not the brace count is not 0.]

Part 9 - end scene

Robot Fun ends when we have entered the program.

When robot fun ends: 
	placeholder "Daniel's robot does all the marbles, then messes with SARG (Stacy's robot), whose 'jet boots' fly it around uncontrollably.  Aidan smashes it angrily.  Instructor Antonia tsks Aidan for method and Stacy for lacking 'safety features'. Aidan apologizes to Antonia, shoots a dark look at Stacy, and leaves.  Stacy is upset, and Daniel wonders what's wrong with his brother.";
	ifndef debug;
	pause the game;
	enddef debug.



Book 6 - The Protector

Part 1 - opens

The Protector is a chapter-length scene.  The protector begins when Robot Fun ends.

under the greenwood tree is an exterior room. "Thou art in the company of thy master's men, the merry men of Sherwood Forest.  'Tis a sunny morning in May, and the merry birds doth sing in the trees above."

Some birds are scenery in under the greenwood tree. "The birds doth twitter on unseen.  They are but of little import, and thus the simulation extendeth not to their very appearance."

Some merry green trees are scenery in under the greenwood tree. "No greener trees than these do grow, nay, not in all of merry England." The printed name of the merry green trees is "trees". 

When the Protector begins:
	say "Things are a little tense Friday evening, and through most of Saturday.  Stacy is angry with Aidan for what he did to SARG, Aidan is being all sulky and broody and unsociable, and Ava seems to have had an argument with Stacy over who was right or wrong in the Great Robotics Class Incident.  You, meanwhile, have simply been watching the ebb and flow of everybody's emotional states.

You're getting better at this.  Some things don't even register as smells or sounds or colors any more, but as recognizable emotions.  So of course, since you're the one who can see the best time to approach people, you're the one to go gather everyone together for Sunday's event.";
	ifndef debug;
	pause the game; 
	enddef debug;
	now the chapter number is 6;
	now the current term day is day 8;
	now the time of day is 1:30 PM;
	say "LEAP, Day 8 (Sunday) - Mid-afternoon

Everyone looks forward to Sim Sunday!  That's when people get to go into the Simulation Room and play through the scenario that some of the counselors have spent the whole year putting together.  It is quite literally THE great virtual reality event of the entire camp.

The Simulation Room functions as a sort of giant virtual reality suit, recreating a whole other world that you and a few other campers can enter and interact with.  There's always a scenario of some sort involved: a few campers are let in to run through it, some playing principal speaking parts while others play less important roles or even just stand around as non-speaking extras.  Everybody wants to get in on this, of course, so as soon as one group has played through the scenario, they're moved out while another group starts over again.

This year, they're doing Robin Hood And The Monk.  You went through this as a non-speaking extra (Random Church-Goer #5) this morning, but this time around you've snagged a major speaking role: you're Little John.  Or rather, thou art Little John.  [']Tis of great importance that thou immerseth thyself in thy part, is[']t not?";
	now Aidan is in under the greenwood tree;
	now Stacy is in under the greenwood tree;
	now Aidan follows the player;
	now the player is in under the greenwood tree.


Understand "Robin" as Aidan when in chapter 6. Rule for printing the name of Aidan when in chapter 6: say "Robin".
Understand "little/john" or "little john" as yourself when in chapter 6. Rule for printing the name of yourself when in chapter 6: say "Little John".
Understand "Much/son/miller's" or "miller's son" as Stacy when in chapter 6. Rule for printing the name of Stacy when in chapter 6: say "Much".

Part 2 - on the road

Understand "cheer [someone]" or "cheer [someone] up" as talking to. 

Instead of doing something other than looking, examining when in chapter 6 and SOMETHING_ROTTEN_IN_NOTTINGHAM is not fired:
	if SET_SCENE is not fired, say Aidan quips SET_SCENE instead;
	if MUCHS_ARG is not fired, say Aidan quips MUCHS_ARG instead;
	if SOMETHING_ROTTEN_IN_NOTTINGHAM is not fired, say Aidan quips SOMETHING_ROTTEN_IN_NOTTINGHAM instead;

[Instead of conversing when the noun is Aidan and in under the greenwood tree:
	if SET_SCENE is not fired, fire SET_SCENE instead;
	if MUCHS_ARG is not fired, fire MUCHS_ARG instead;
	if SOMETHING_ROTTEN_IN_NOTTINGHAM is not fired, fire SOMETHING_ROTTEN_IN_NOTTINGHAM instead;]

Check going nowhere when in chapter 6: say "Nottingham lies to the east." instead.
Check going when in chapter 6 and SET_SCENE is not fired: placeholder "unsportsmanlike to wander from the script! There's supposed to be dialogue betwixt Little Jon (that's you) and Robin Hood." instead.

Instead of conversing when the noun is Stacy and in chapter 6, say "Forsooth, such existeth not within the bounds of this simulation." 

SET_SCENE is a quip. The display text is "'I dunno, John, it's just that every Sunday we're here in the woods, it's like there's no difference from day to day, you know?  And today is White Sunday, too.  I really should be in church.  It's been two weeks since I've been to Mass.'

'Then let us go, for if that is what ailest thee, then we shouldst find both salve and salvation at Nottingham church.'

Robin fixeth upon thee a look of no small wonderment.  'You've been double-dipping into the Shakespeare, haven't you?  Well, I think it's a good idea, anyway.  To Nottingham!'"


MUCHS_ARG is a quip. The display text is "'Wait,' quoth Much, the miller's son, 'aren't you wanted in Nottingham for highway robbery?  You should take some men with you.  Twelve guys, maybe, to watch your back.'

'No way, I'm not taking anyone except Little John, to carry my bow.  Everything will be fine.'"

SOMETHING_ROTTEN_IN_NOTTINGHAM is a quip. The display text is "Er, according to the poem, this is the part where thou art supposed to tell Robin to carry his own bow, as thou shalt be carrying thine own, but Robin seemeth not to heed the script, and fixeth Much with a stern and a terrible eye.  'Are you trying to tell me I can't take care of myself?'

'Do whatever you want,' quoth Much, who sulketh and looketh away all too quickly.  Methinks the lad be not comfortable arguing with Robin.

'Fine.' Robin taketh up his bow, and bids thee take thine own.  'Let's get moving.'"


Part 3 - archery contest


The old archery range is an exterior room. "Though all of Sherwood be thy range, this sunny glen doth lend itself best to thy sport.  A stump by thy feet doth provide adequate place for thy wager, and targets lean upon the trees at the opposite side of the glen."

The stump is scenery supporter in the old archery range. "[']Tis as flat as a table, and hath oft served as a place upon which to place thy wagers when thou and thy friends take up thy bows against thy fearsome foes, the targets."

The target is scenery in the old archery range. "Many is the time that thou hast waged honorable war against them, yet there they stand, as whole as ever they were on the day upon which they had been carved."  Instead of doing something other than examining or attacking the target, say "But thy target is three hundred paces away." 

under the greenwood tree is west of the old archery range.  Nottingham is east of the old archery range. Nottingham is visited. [player never gets to Nottingham, but I want the GO NOWHERE message to imply its out there.]


The Archery Contest is a scene.  The archery contest begins when in the old archery range.

When the archery contest begins: say "'Ah, the old archery range.  Good times, eh?  I think we've got some time before Mass, so how about a bit of archery practice?  I'll give you 3 to 1 odds: three pennies to you for every target you hit, if you'll give me one for every target I hit.'

'Thou shalt be the poorer man for this, I'll wager!'

'Yeah, yeah, notch up and shoot the targets already.'"

Check going during the archery contest: placeholder "unsportsmanlike to leave during your contest" instead.

The-one-about-nothing-much is scenery in the archery range. Understand "much" as the-one-about-nothing-much. The printed name of the-one-about-nothing-much is "Much".
Check an actor examining the-one-about-nothing-much during the archery contest: say "'Wait, Sir Robin.  I cannot shoot with thee now, for I cannot see Much!'

Thou grineth, but verily, it seemeth thou hast annoyeth Sir Robin."; placeholder "Check my language, please. --RN" instead.

[Check singing when in chapter 6: say "'Cheerest up, Sir Robin.  Here, I shall sing to thee:

When evil rearth its ugly head
Brave Sir Robin turnth tail and fled
He's the brave, brave, br--

'That's enough, Daniel,' snaps Aidan." instead.]


John's score and Robin's score are numbers that vary.

Check attacking the target when in chapter 6 for the first time: say "Thy arrow is unfortunately wide of the target.  Robin doth smirk as he fitteth an arrow upon his own bowstring.

Robin doth raise up his bow and let fly his shot, straight and true, to the heart of the target.  Well shot, indeed." instead.

Check attacking the target when in chapter 6 for the second time: say "Well shot!  Thou art another three pennies ahead of thy companion!

Robin doth shoot his arrow, which misseth the target by a hair.  With a scowl, he bids thee take thy turn." instead.

Check attacking the target when in chapter 6 for the third time: say "Thy arrow seemeth to shimmer in its flight, and striketh the target but close to the edge.  A lucky shot indeed!

Robin shooteth, but scoreth not."; rule succeeds.

Check attacking the target when in chapter 6: say "Thy arrow leaps through the air into thy mark.  Well shot!" instead. 

The archery contest ends in Little John's favor when we have attacked the target.
The archery contest ends in Robin Hood's favor when Robin's score is two.

Part 4 - two cents worth

Section 1 - scene

Two cents worth is a scene. Two cents worth begins when the archery contest ends.

When the archery contest ends in Robin Hood's favor:  say Aidan quips 2CENTS-10.
When the archery contest ends in Little John's favor: say "Thou art a full two shillings, or four-and-twenty pennies, ahead of thy companion.  Verily, thou hast won the contest.  With ill humor, Robin doth gather up the arrows and prepareth to continue upon his way to Nottingham."

Instead during two cents worth (this is the bother Robin for pennies rule):
	if looking, make no decision;
	if examining, make no decision;
	if conversing, make no decision;
	say "Wait, did Robin not promise to pay thee three pennies for every target thou didst hit?  Thou must demand of him this payment, for it is in the script."

Understand "payment", "pennies", "shillings", "wager", "bet", "winnings" as the dollars when in chapter 6.

Report inquiring Aidan about dollars during two cents worth: say Aidan quips 2CENTS-01 instead.
[Report asking Aidan about when the player's command includes "payment/pennies/shillings/wager/bet/money/winnings" during two cents worth: fire 2CENTS-01 instead.]

Understand "asking [Aidan] for [text]" as asking it about when two cents worth is happening.

Check talking to Aidan during two cents worth: say Aidan quips 2CENTS-01 instead.

Two cents worth ends when 2CENTS-04 is fired or 2CENTS-10 is fired.

When the Protector ends:

	say "Aidan ([']tis useless now to call him 'Robin', for he hath dropped all pretense of playing the part) doth take a menacing step towards you, forcing you to backpedal in alarm.  You can sense the rush of emotion in and around him, like a hurricane, building in intensity.  He raises a fist to make a point, but you have no idea what he's saying because the force of his emotion has, at that point, suddenly exploded in your face, knocking you flat out on your back.

The next thing you know, you are sitting up outside the simulation room.  Brad, your counselor, is kneeling beside you with a concerned look on his face.  'Whew, almost thought we'd have to ship you over to the hospital again.  You okay?  I'm afraid we can't put you back into the sim as Little John.  We didn't know how long you'd be out, so we let someone else take your place.'

Behind him, you can see Aidan apologizing madly to the other counselors.  Clearly he's been pulled out of the sim too, and been replaced.  But there's something wrong with the picture ... it isn't until later that you realise that this time, unlike the incident with Stacy's robot, he really doesn't care whether or not he did anything wrong....";

At least, that's what you keep telling everybody who asks, especially the ones who stink of Morbid Curiosity.  You're guessing that your little fainting spell, at the Sim Sunday event, was something similar to what happened at dinner with Lucian last week, but at least this time round you didn't wind up in the hospital.  It looks really bad for Aidan, though: some of the people who used to hang out with him are giving him the cold shoulder now, and Stacy is definitely actively avoiding him.

You have no idea what sort of emotion could have knocked you out like that.  And you're kind of leery of checking out Aidan's emotional status these days....";

Part 2 - Tracking down Lucian

Tracking Lucian is a scene. Tracking Lucian begins when Ava gets Daniel's help ends.

Last check going from the auditorium when A-alarm-5 is unfired during Ava gets Daniel's help: say Ava quips A-alarm-5.

FEAR-TRAIL-DETECTED is a trigger.

Check focusing on a room which is not the film studio south when FEAR-TRAIL-DETECTED is unfired during tracking Lucian: say "You sense a confusion of trails, all of them scented with fear.  More than one of them seem strong enough to be Lucian's, assuming he's as terrified as you think he is, though none are precisely alike." instead.

Report focusing on a room during tracking Lucian: say "[if in the Film Studio South][fire FEAR-TRAIL-DETECTED]Here's where it all began.  You can sense the explosion of rage and the responding burst of fear, right in the middle of what seems to be an actual physical explosion.  Both rage and fear race off towards the north end of the room.[otherwise if in Film Studio North]You trace Lucian's terror to the bookshelves, and then into the depths of the open vent.  [one of]You point out the trail to Ava, who looks at the damaged wall around the vent and says, 'I suppose Aidan must have tried to force his own way into the vent after Lucian.  Is Lucian in there still?'  She tries shouting into the vent, but receives no response.  [or][stopping]It's clear that Lucian must have crawled some distance through the vents already.[otherwise if In Northeast Corner of Claremont] Standing on tiptoe and craning your neck towards the ceiling, you can sense Lucian's trail tracing a path through the HVAC system from east to west.[otherwise if In northern Hallway]Standing on tiptoe and craning your neck towards the ceiling, you can sense Lucian's trail tracing a path through the HVAC system from east to north.[otherwise if in Claremont Library]You can sense abject terror pooling about the air vent over the circulation desk, practically dripping onto the papers below.[paragraph break][Ava quips Lucian-found][otherwise]You seem to have lost the trail.  None of the emotions here seem to match Lucian's."; rule succeeds.

Tracking Lucian ends when Lucian-found is fired.

Lucian-found is a quip. The display text is "'There,' you say, pointing to the vent.  'He's in there.'  You sense the terror leaking out of the vent suddenly grow more pungent.

Ava gets up onto the desk and calls into the vent, 'Lucian!  Are you there?  You have to come out.  We'll get you somewhere safe.'

Lucian's response is barely audible.  'No.  Shan't.  Go away.'"


Every turn during tracking Lucian (this is the Aidan turns up the heat rule):
	if the HVAC unit is switched off, do nothing instead;
	if the time since tracking Lucian began is:
	-- 10 minutes: say "Hm, is it just you or is it getting a bit warmer than usual?  Could be the adrenaline talking.";
	-- 20 minutes: say "It's definitely getting a bit warm now.";
	-- 30 minutes: say "It's getting uncomfortably warm.  You can hear the hot air blowing through the various air vents all around.";
	-- 40 minutes: say "It's getting very hot in here, and the hot air coming through the vents now smells slightly burnt.";
	-- 50 minutes: say "Who knew the HVAC systems could get this hot?  You could probably roast something in one of the vents.";
	-- 60 minutes: 
		say "In fact, you can roast something in the vents, as the authorities discover shortly afterwards.  Poor Lucian, too afraid to come out of his hiding place in one of those vents, is cooked alive.  Ava goes into hysterics at the discovery; her emotional outburst sends you reeling and by the time you are steady on your feet again, Aidan has been taken away by armed guards and men with mirror shades and black suits.  You never see your brother again ... in fact, all evidence that he ever existed seems to vanish from the face of the earth.";

Rule for supplying a missing second noun when amplifying during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: now the second noun is Lucian.

[After deciding the scope of the player during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: place Lucian in scope. [this just evades the parser's whiny "i don't know the word Lucian" error.  AFter this, then the physical sim whines, too, because it's too stupid to realize seeing != hearing.  ]]

Rule for reaching inside an air vent when conversing: allow access. [i.e., can hear]
Rule for reaching inside an air vent when amplifying: allow access. [i.e., can hear]


Chapter 3 - try talking or calming Lucian first

[Check amplifying calm for Lucian during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: say Ava quips CALMING-LUC instead.] CALMING-LUC is a trigger. [The display text is "Easy enough to say, but.... 'Hey Lucian,' you say, 'chill out, okay?'  Ava gives you an incredulous look.  She was always better at this sort of thing than you."]  [an empath wouldn't say that]

[try talking to Lucian]
Instead of conversing when the noun is Lucian during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: say "You get no response, though you can easily tell that he's there; and, by the fluctuating emotions around the vent, that he can hear you."

Persuasion for asking Lucian to try doing anything during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: say "He's really too frightened to do anything but hunker down inside the vent and wait for the world to end." instead.

Persuasion rule for asking Ava to try singing during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: persuasion succeeds.
Persuasion rule for asking Ava to try singing a little during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: persuasion succeeds.

Report Ava singing a little "[lean on me]" when CALMING-LUC is NOT fired during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: try asking Ava about the topic understood; say "'Anyway, aren't you his hero?  Try calming him down, or something.'" instead.

Report Ava singing [anything] when in Claremont Library and CALMING-LUC is fired during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: say "'Daniel, this isn't really the time.'

'Just try it, Ava.'

She sighs.  'Fine.'  Clearing her throat, she sings a random folk song from her collection.  This does not seem to have any effect on Lucian, unfortunately." instead.


Chapter 5 - try your new power out for the first time, discover the need for a "kernel"

Check amplifying curiosity for Lucian when in Claremont Library and LEAN-ON-AVA is not fired during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: say "What curiosity?  There is no curiosity here but my own." instead.

Check amplifying calm for Lucian when in Claremont Library and LEAN-ON-AVA is not fired during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: fire CALMING-LUC; say "[one of]Trying to muffle Lucian's fear is like trying to bail out a sinking ship with a teaspoon.  You can't do it, not without some sense of calm to take the place of the fear.[or]You sense no calm here to magnify.[cycling]" instead.


Chapter 6 - power fails, no kernel  now Ava is more malleable She will sing LOM

Report asking Ava about "[lean on me]" when CALMING-LUC is fired during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: say Ava quips NOT-THAT-SONG instead.  
Report Ava singing a little "[lean on me]" when CALMING-LUC is fired during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: say Ava quips NOT-THAT-SONG instead.  
Report Ava singing when NOT-THAT-SONG is fired during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: say Ava quips NOT-THAT-SONG instead.

NOT-THAT-SONG is a quip. The display text is "[one of]'But I hate that song!' Ava glances back at the vent.  'Okay, you're right, if that's the only way to get him calm enough to listen to reason, I'll do it.[or][stopping][if not in Claremont Library][otherwise if the library air vent is closed][Ava quips GRILL-IN-THE-WAY][otherwise][Ava quips LEAN-ON-AVA][end if]  ". 


Chapter 7 - oh, that vent is screwed shut 

GRILL-IN-THE-WAY is a quip. The display text is "[one of]  But we'd[or]'We'd[stopping] better get that grill out first.  If that song does calm Lucian down enough, we don't want to waste time trying to unscrew it.'"

Check inquiring Ava about the screwdriver when the screwdriver is not enclosed by the location during Lucian's Bad Day: say Ava quips SCREWDRIVER-LOVE instead.
Check inquiring Ava about the library air vent when the screwdriver is not enclosed by the location during Lucian's Bad Day: say Ava quips SCREWDRIVER-LOVE instead.

SCREWDRIVER-LOVE is a quip. The display text is "Ava shakes her head.  'If Stacy were here, she'd have a screwdriver, and--'[paragraph break]'I think she was in one of the classes here!  Maybe she left it there when the alarm went off?'" 


Chapter 8 - Ava and then Daniel does their things

LEAN-ON-AVA is a [beautiful] quip. The display text is "Ava takes her place on the circulation desk and begins singing softly into the vent.  You can sense curiosity blossoming in the middle of all the fear, and then ... there it is, a kernel of calm! [run paragraph on]"

Report amplifying curiosity for Lucian when in Claremont Library and LEAN-ON-AVA is fired during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: say "You grab hold of that sense of curiosity and, you're not sure how, pull it over the fear.  It somehow drags that kernel of calm along.  Curiosity and calm quickly amplify, while fear shrinks before them....  [paragraph break][Ava quips Extracting-Lucian]" instead.

Report amplifying calm for Lucian when in Claremont Library and LEAN-ON-AVA is fired during coaxing Lucian out of the vents: say "You're not sure how you're doing this, but the adrenaline pumping in your veins gives you enough of a boost to grab that tiny kernel of a sense of well-being and magnify it.  At the same time, the fear and the anxiety seems to damp down a bit: a person can only feel so much emotion at a time, after all.  [paragraph break][Ava quips Extracting-Lucian]" instead.


Chapter 9 - end puzzle

Coaxing Lucian out of the vents ends when Extracting-Lucian is fired. 

Extracting-Lucian is a quip. The display text is "Slowly, Lucian's head appears in the open mouth of the ventilation shaft.  The fear spikes for a moment as he looks around, but when he sees no-one but you and Ava, he calms down enough to emerge further.  Finally, he comes out enough for you to grab him and carefully help him down onto the desk and then down to the floor.

Ava stops singing.  'Good.  Now, we'd better get out of here before--'

You don't need to turn around.  The heat of the burning rage behind you is enough to tell you that Aidan has just chosen the worst possible moment to check in on the library.  Ava, turning white as a sheet, tries to shield Lucian, who meanwhile has made a mad scramble for the barrier to the main part of the library.

Aidan burns right past you to get at Lucian, pushing Ava aside as she tries to pull him back.  Lucian manages to duck just in time, and the barrier reverberates from the force of Aidan's fist hitting it."



Part 4 - Lucian attacks Aidan

Saving Lucian From Aidan is a scene. Saving Lucian From Aidan begins when coaxing Lucian out of the vents ends.

When Saving Lucian from Aidan begins: now Aidan is in the location.

Every turn during saving Lucian from Aidan (this is the Aidan attempts murder rule):
	if saving Lucian from Aidan is happening for the first turn, say "Aidan lunges for Lucian, who twists away just in time.  There is a sharp cracking sound from the barrier as Aidan slams into it." instead;
	if saving Lucian from Aidan is happening for the second turn, say "Lucian tries to make a break for the exit, but Aidan, moving faster than you though possible, vaults over the circulation desk and into Lucian's escape path.  Lucian squeaks in terror and scrambles back to the barrier." instead;
	if saving Lucian from Aidan is happening for the third turn, say "Aidan makes a grab for Lucian, and gets a fistful of his shirt.  The fabric rips, and Lucian goes sprawling across the floor." instead;
	if saving Lucian from Aidan is happening for the fourth turn, say "Aidan pounces on Lucian, this time getting his right hand on Lucian's throat.  He lifts Lucian, kicking and coughing into the air." instead;
	if saving Lucian from Aidan is happening for the fifth turn and the player is not in the battlefield: 
		say "There is a sickening crunch as Aidan's hand closes around Lucian's throat, and the smaller boy goes limp.  Behind you, Ava begins screaming.  As for yourself, you are nearly overwhelmed by a wave of black horror, much of it coming from yourself.  You black out....

You are told, when you regain consciousness, that Aidan was 'taken away'; accounts differ as to who exactly did the taking.  Some say it was the police, others say it was the army.  A few people whisper about conspiracies and men in black.  Regardless, you never see your brother again."; 
		end the story saying "You have lost your brother and your friend".


Instead of conversing when the noun is Ava during saving Lucian from Aidan, say "'I don't know, just do something!'  Ava is wide-eyed and almost panicking."

Instead of conversing during saving Lucian from Aidan, say "He seems a little busy right now."

Check focusing on Claremont Library during saving lucian from Aidan: 
	[unless the noun is Lucian or the noun is Ava,] try focusing on Aidan instead. [try so the "for the first time" stuff works]

Check focusing on Lucian during saving lucian from Aidan: say "The pure survival instinct of doomed prey." instead.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while amplifying during saving Lucian from Aidan: now the second noun is Aidan.

Check amplifying anger for Aidan when in chapters 7 through 8: say "[italic type]Maybe it'll make him black out[roman type], you think desperately.  But as Aidan's rage threatens to bury you alive, it becomes clear that you'd be the one to black out first, and lose control of the situation." instead.

Check amplifying it for when Aidan is the second noun and in chapters 7 through 8: say "There's too much of it!  No matter how much you try, Aidan's rage just keeps pouring from him in never-ending supplies!" instead.


Saving Lucian From Aidan ends when the player is in the battlefield.


Part 5 - A Glimpse into the Mindscape

Every turn when the player is in the Battlefield for three turns: fire BOOM.  BOOM is a trigger. 

Lucian's bad day ends when BOOM is fired.


When Lucian's bad day ends: 
	say "A shadow falls upon you.  Looking up, you see a massive shell headed directly towards you!  You try to run, but, as if in a dream, you feel like you're running through molasses ... there's a sharp crack as something strikes you in the back of your head and you think for a moment that you're dead, but....";
	ifndef debug;
	pause the game;
	enddef debug;
	say "You blink.  You're lying on the floor, staring up at the ceiling of the Fine Arts Library, and it is singularly free of the panic and rage that saturated the air the last time you were here.  Instead, there's a sort of hysterical worrying that you quickly trace to Ava ... who is standing over the unconscious form of your brother Aidan, a large granite paperweight clutched in her hands.

'What happened?' she says, staring at you.  'What did you do?  One moment Aidan's trying to kill Lucian, next minute you're both as still as statues and I knew I had to grab the chance and oh I hit Aidan with a paperweight and you both fell over ... Daniel, what on earth just happened?'

You sit up and rub the back of your head where it still feels as though you'd been hit with a paperweight ... though there's certainly no evidence of anything ever having struck you there at all.  'I'm not sure.  I think ... I think I was actually inside Aidan's head there.  It's....'  You shake your head.  'We should get Aidan and Lucian back to the counselors.'

Something is terribly wrong with Aidan, and that has got to be the understatement of the year."


Book 8 - Night Terrors

Night Terrors is a chapter-length scene. Night Terrors begins when Lucian's Bad Day ends.

When Night Terrors begins:
	say "Aidan is sedated and taken to the hospital 'for further observation'.  It's all very dramatic, but not in a good way.  Dr Rose thanks you and Ava personally for your help, and then things go back to normal.  Sort of.

Aidan didn't come back that day, or the day after.  Nobody knows anything.  Ava tends to babble when you try to talk to her about it, and Stacy seems to prefer to not talk about it at all.  Heaven knows, you're probably in too much shock to make much sense, anyway.  So all you can do is try to force yourself back into the normal routine to take your mind off of things.  Thank goodness for the normal camp routine.  If you didn't have that, you'd need to be under 'further observation' too.";

Thump.

Snore.

Thump!

You wake up suddenly to the sound of someone or something hitting your dorm room door.  Jeremy is already up, and has turned on the lights.  He's just about to say something to you when the door smashes open and Aidan, of all people, comes stumbling in.  He's clearly been pumped full of sedatives, but that's not stopping him from glaring around the room like some sort of mad, enraged bull.  Jeremy, terrified, cowers in his bed as Aidan advances on you.

'You ... die....'  His speech is slurred and he's been slowed down significantly by the sedatives.  That doesn't mean you can get away from him just like that, the room's too small for you to get out past him.

A high-pitched beep draws your attention to SARG, whom Stacy must have left hidden in here somewhere.  The little guy activates and flies straight at Aidan, who roars angrily and is momentarily distracted -- just long enough for you to slip out into the hallway!

You can feel Aidan's mad rage burning at your back as he lumbers out behind you.";
	now the player is in your room;
	now Aidan is in your room.



[FIRST TIME VISITING PITS ROOMS WEST]

First carry out going to pits west when in chapter 8 for the first time: say "As you run into this part of the hallway, one of the doors opens a crack.  Lucian pops his head out just long enough to see Aidan roaring up after you, and then he slams the door shut again." [no instead ]

First carry out going from pits west when in chapter 8 for the first time: say "You hear Lucian's door open again, and Lucian himself running off in another direction.  You hope he's gone to get help."; Brad's big moment in 4 turns from now. [no instead -- just narrate]

Check going to an exterior room when in chapter 8: say "A still-fresh image of Aidan shooting down the long, straight corridors of Claremont, still gaining speed as he came to a corner, flashes through your mind when you glimpse the wide open expanse of [if the noun is west]the front lawn[otherwise]Calvin Field[end if] ahead of you, and you instantly know that going outside would be suicide." instead.

From what you overhear from the orderlies, it looks like Aidan is building up a tolerance to the drugs that they've been using to keep him under: that's why he managed to escape from the hospital tonight.

Now, that is an aspect of your power that I had not anticipated, and I must say I find it quite fascinating.  It might, I suspect it might be of great use to Aidan right now.

'We're too evenly matched,' he says, in between deflecting the thief's knife and trying to land a punch, 'I could really use an edge here....'[or]'Daniel!' Aidan shouts, holding out his hand.  The thief attacks him right then, interrupting him, and now he's too busy with the thief to finish whatever it was he was trying to tell you.[stopping]"

To say Aidan shows up to fight the thief with you: say "Out of nowhere, someone leaps in between you and the thief!  It's Aidan, and more to the point, it's the Aidan that you remember, the one who helps you handle bullies and carries you to the hospital when you freak out in the dining hall!  He barely has time to give you a 'hi Daniel' before he and the thief are locked in mortal combat with each other...."; move Aidan to the location.

Check attacking Aidan when the player has the sword: say "Aidan certainly isn't expecting that, but he's quick enough to dodge your attack.  You've distracted him just enough, however.[Go straight to section You Fail To Give Aidan The Sword]" instead.

	say "With a sudden lunge, the Thief slips through Aidan's defenses and buries his knife in Aidan's stomach.  Aidan has time to give you one horrified look before his eyes roll up and he collapses.  The mindscape wavers for a moment, then shatters, and that is the last thing you know.

No really, it's the last thing you know.  Both you and Aidan spend the next twenty-odd years in a coma, knowing nothing of what's going on around you.  It's a terrible fate, and if you were conscious enough to formulate a thought, you would probably wonder what you could have done differently in that last fight that would have averted this.";
	end the story saying "You lose your brother and your mind."


First check giving the sword to Aidan: now Aidan has the sword; say  "You put the sword on the ground and slide it over to Aidan, who kicks it up into his hands and swings it up to block the Thief's knife.  He's much faster than you are, given the super-speed and super-strength, and you can hear the sword whistling through the air as it whirls, a blue blur around the Thief.  In less than a minute, the Thief's knife goes flying off into the darkness, and the Thief himself is cut down.

There's no blood.

Aidan stands over the Thief, leaning on the sword and panting.  He flashes you a familiar smile.  'Thanks, Daniel.  He almost had me there.  If you hadn't passed me the sword....'  He shakes his head.  'Now, let's see who this fellow is behind his mask.'  Leaning down, he pulls off the Thief's mask, revealing the face of ... Dr Claudia Rose.

The scene wavers and dissolves all around you.  Aidan is saying something, but you can't hear him.  And in a moment, you are back in the hospital room, looking at the real Dr Rose, who is smiling quite happily.  'You did it, Daniel!  I knew you could do it!  Look, your brother's looking more peaceful already.'

It's true.  Aidan's still unconscious, but he looks a great deal more relaxed, with the same expression of peace that you saw when you put the ring on him back there in the Land of the Dead.  Whatever was going wrong in his head, it's over now."; now everything carried by the player is in the location; now everything worn by the player is in the location; rule succeeds.

Somewhere else in the dining hall, Aidan is sitting with a small handful of friends who still think he's okay, murderous psycho rages or not.

section 3 - CONVERSATION C10.1 (Dr Rose)

C10.1 is a quip. The display text is "'One thing I don't understand,' Ava muses, 'is why the last Thief turned out to be Dr Rose.  I mean, what's the connection?'"

	C10.1m01 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Um, she's the doctor who's been keeping him sedated all the time?'" The following quip is C10.1-01.
	C10.1m02 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Um, she's the big authority figure here now that Damon Rose is gone?'" The following quip is C10.1-02.
	C10.1m03 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Why does there have to be a connection?'" The following quip is C10.1-03.
	C10.1m04 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Maybe she's secretly an evil supervillain who's been behind everything this year.'" The following quip is C10.1-04.

	The response of C10.1 is { C10.1m01, C10.1m02, C10.1m03, C10.1m04 }.

C10.1-01 is a quip. The display text is "Ava looks doubtful.  'Maybe.  But, I don't know, that seems like a really recent thing, you know?  You've been his brother all your life, and of course he's known himself all his life too -- oh, you know what I mean! -- but this thing with Dr Rose is, like, just a couple of days ago.'

'You worry too much,' says Stacy."

C10.1-02 is a quip. The display text is "'That could be it, I suppose.  Maybe Aidan really misses Damon Rose and secretly resents Dr Rose for taking over.'

'That sounds pretty plausible.'

Ava nods slowly, but doesn't seem entirely convinced."

C10.1-03 is a quip. The display text is "'There's always a connection.  Our brains aren't quite that random.  Isn't that right, Stacy?'

'I think people are pretty random.  Maybe Aidan just fixed on the last person he saw before he went under sedation again.'

'That really doesn't sound right,' mutters Ava.  Stacy rolls her eyes."

C10.1-04 is a quip. The display text is "Lucian gives a loud bark of laughter.  'Yeah right.  I mean, look at her, she's like somebody's favorite aunt.'

Ava gives you a look of exasperation.  'Really, Daniel, if you can't take this seriously....'

'You're the only one who thinks it means anything, Ava,' says Stacy."


section 4 - CONVERSATION C10.2 (Aidan)

C10.2 is a quip. The display text is "'I'm surprised to see Aidan here,' says Stacy, glancing over to where your brother is sitting.  'I should have thought they'd have kept him in the hospital until your folks came to get you.  Or maybe even shipping him straight home right away.'"

	C10.2m01 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Mom and Dad have been kind of tied up overseas.  I don't know how much they've been told about what's up with Aidan, anyway.  I guess they'll find out when they get here tomorrow.'" The following quip is C10.2-01.
	C10.2m02 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'You're not still mad at him about SARG, are you?'" The following quip is C10.2-02.
	C10.2m03 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'I don't know.  I guess it's Dr Rose's decision, and she knows what she's doing.'" The following quip is C10.2-03.

	The response of C10.2 is { C10.2m01, C10.2m02, C10.2m03 }.

C10.2-01 is a quip. The display text is "'Oh, that's tough.'  Stacy chews slowly on some bacon, and resists the temptation to spit it out.  'I hadn't thought of that ... it's going to be weird living with Aidan now, isn't it?  After everything that's happened?'"

	C10.2m04 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Yeah, a little.  But, he's still my brother.'" The following quip is C10.2-04.
	C10.2m05 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Nah, he's my brother!  How can it be weird?'" The following quip is C10.2-05.

	The response of C10.2-01 is { C10.2m04, C10.2m05 }.

C10.2-02 is a quip. The display text is "Stacy relents a little.  'He did stop me just a few minutes ago to apologize,' she admits.  She shrugs.  'He says he doesn't feel angry all the time anymore.  Is this true?'

You nod.  'The super-strength seems to be gone, too, so he's exactly back to the same old Aidan.'

Stacy reaches around you to poke Ava, who squeaks and bats Stacy's hand away.[C10.2 ends tree]"

C10.2-03 is a quip. The display text is "You add that Aidan's back to normal now, anyway: no more mad rages, but then no more super-strength either.  So it must be all right.  Right?  Everyone nods sagely: Dr Rose is the expert, after all.  [C10.2 ends tree][if C10.1 is not fired][Stacy quips C10.1]"

C10.2-04 is a quip. The display text is "Ava looks pleased, but Stacy looks skeptical.  'Aren't you worried he might try to kill you again?'"

	C10.2m06 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'No, he's back to normal.  No super-rage, no super-strength.  Nothing to worry about.'" The following quip is C10.2-06.
	C10.2m07 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Oh, I think I can handle him if he tries anything.'" The following quip is C10.2-07.

	The response of C10.2-04 is { C10.2m06, C10.2m07 }.

C10.2-05 is a quip. The display text is "Ava and Stacy exchange glances, then look back at you and say, 'yeah, it's going to be weird.'"

	C10.2m08 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'No no, he's totally back to the way he was before.  The rage is gone: I guess I must have killed it.  And the super-strength is gone, too.'" The following quip is C10.2-06.

	The response of C10.2-05 is { C10.2m08 }.

C10.2-06 is a quip. The display text is "'Seriously?' says Lucian, 'that's ... kind of sad, really.  I mean, super-strength is one of the more awesome abilities out there, you know?'

'Lucian, he tried to kill you once.  Do you seriously want him to turn back into that monster?'

Lucian shrugs, and Ava whispers to you: 'Lucian seems to have gotten a lot braver ever since that night when Aidan tried to kill you and he had to go wake up the counselors.'  Huh, maybe the kid will be all right after all.[C10.2 ends tree]"

C10.2-07 is a quip. The display text is "'Ooh!'  Lucian is all starry-eyed admiration, but the girls know better.  'He's back to normal, isn't he?' asks Stacy.

'Yeah,' you admit, 'he's not mad all the time anymore, but then he's not super-strong anymore either.  So yeah, I can handle him the same way I used to handle him before this whole business started.'

Stacy nods.  Apparently Aidan mentioned something about this earlier, when he stopped her to apologize for what he did to SARG.[C10.2 ends tree]"


section 5 - CONVERSATION C10.3 (Powers 1)

C10.3 is a quip. The display text is "'So Daniel,' says Lucian, 'how awesome was it to go adventuring inside someone's brain?  Think you could do that in mine?'"

	C10.3m01 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'I don't think so.  Dr Rose thinks those funny emo powers kind of got blown away the last time I got blown out of Aidan's head.'" The following quip is C10.3-01.
	C10.3m02 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Yeah, sure.  Maybe.'" The following quip is C10.3-02.

	The response of C10.3 is { C10.3m01, C10.3m02 }.

C10.3-01 is a quip. The display text is "'Aw man, you mean they're gone?  For good?  No way!'

You shrug.  'They were getting kind of annoying anyway,' you say, but Lucian still looks heartbroken at the news.[C10.3 ends tree]"

C10.3-02 is a quip. The display text is "'Awesome!'

But Ava suddenly says, 'Oh!  That's what's different about you today: you've lost that funny sort-of-glazed look you've had all week!  So ... you've gotten totally used to being able to sense everybody's emotions now?'"

	C10.3m03 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Um, well actually, no.  The powers are gone.'" The following quip is C10.3-03.
	C10.3m04 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Of course.  I had to get used to them sooner or later.'" The following quip is C10.3-04.

	The response of C10.3-02 is { C10.3m03, C10.3m04 }.

C10.3-03 is a quip. The display text is "You explain that it looks like you pretty much used up all of your powers during your adventures in Aidan's head.  Dr Rose seemed a little disappointed about it, but you're kind of glad, actually: that emo-sensory power wasn't exactly very comfortable to live with.

Lucian and Stacy both look a little disappointed as well, but Ava says, 'well, as long as you're happy about it.'  It's a bit of a relief not being able to tell if she's just pretending to be happy for you.[C10.3 ends tree]"

C10.3-04 is a quip. The display text is "Stacy looks at you closely.  'Really?  What am I feeling right now?'"

	C10.3m05 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Curious.'". The following quip is C10.3-05.

	C10.3m06d is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Worried.'". The following quip is C10.3-06.
	C10.3m07 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Totally in love with Hank Thomson.'". The following quip is C10.3-07.

	The response of C10.3-04 is { C10.3m05, C10.3m05b, C10.3m06, C10.3m06b, C10.3m06c, C10.3m06d, C10.3m07 }. 

C10.3-05 is a quip. The display text is "'Anybody could see that,' remarks Ava drily.  The girls don't seem much interested in pursuing the matter.  You catch Lucian's eye, but, rather surprisingly, he drops his gaze and turns his attention back to his food.  You have no idea what he thinks of all this, which is kind of a relief.[C10.3 ends tree]"

C10.3-06 is a quip. The display text is "'Pfft, I am not!' Stacy looks triumphant, then realizes what it means and frowns.  'So they're gone, then.'

Reluctantly, you nod.  'Dr Rose thinks they died in that last confrontation with the Thief in Aidan's head.  I guess it was too good to last, but at least things will go back to normal now.'

'Sorry to hear that.'[C10.3 ends tree]"

C10.3-07 is a quip. The display text is "Stacy gasps and flings a bit of hash brown at you.  You dodge just in time, and it hits Ava instead.  Before this can turn into an all-out food fight, Lucian says to you, 'so do you still have superpowers or not?'

Reluctantly, you admit that your powers are gone.  'Dr Rose thinks they died in that last confrontation with the Thief in Aidan's head.  I guess it was too good to last, but at least things will go back to normal now.'

'Gee, that's too bad.'[C10.3 ends tree]"


section 6 - CONVERSATION 10.4 (Powers 2)

C10.4 is a quip. The display text is "'Oh, here's a thought,' says Stacy suddenly, 'Daniel, could it be something at LEAP that set off your powers?'"

	C10.4m01 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Eh?  What do you mean?'" The following quip is C10.4-01.
	C10.4m02 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'I'm pretty sure of it, actually.'" The following quip is C10.4-02.
	C10.4m03 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'I don't think so.  Aidan's been coming here for years, and nothing's happened until now.'" The following quip is C10.4-03.

	The response of C10.4 is { C10.4m01, C10.4m02, C10.4m03 }.

C10.4-01 is a quip. The display text is "'I mean, it's kind of funny that both you and Aidan should suddenly develop these mutant powers at the same time.  I thought that maybe it's because you're brothers and there's some sort of genetic thing going on with you two, but then why right at the same time?  It doesn't really make sense.'

'Stacy, you think too much.'"

C10.4-02 is a quip. The display text is "'Well, both Aidan and I suddenly picked up these powers while we were here, so I figured it must be something around here that's doing it.  Maybe they're doing some sort of super-secret gamma-ray experiment in one of the nearby buildings.'

'And only you and Aidan were affected.  I suppose if only the two of you had some sort of genetic thing that made you especially likely to react....'  Stacy nods slowly, but still doesn't seem entirely satisfied."

C10.4-03 is a quip. The display text is "'Maybe he's just slower to react to it than you are.'  Stacy doesn't look satisfied.  'Or maybe there's something different about this year.'

'There are lots of things different about this year.  Do you think someone is causing this on purpose?'

'Maybe, but then, why pick on the two of you?  I mean, it would be less suspicious if it were two unrelated people, and if the two of you really were somehow genetically special, then it would be better to get you somewhere else.  Something here doesn't make sense.'

'Stacy, you think too much.'"


section 7 CONVERSATION C10.5 (Food)

C10.5 is a quip. The display text is "Lucian, who's been struggling with a few rashers of bacon, finally swallows the last of it and says, 'one thing I still don't like about this place is the food.  I mean, is it always so ... sweet?  And not even like they put sugar, more like they used some sort of fake sugar instead.'"

	C10.5m01 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'It's always been pretty awful, I thought.'" The following quip is C10.5-01.
	C10.5m02 is a transitional quip. The menu text is "'Yeah, but it's not so bad, really.'" The following quip is C10.5-02.

	The response of C10.5 is { C10.5m01, C10.5m02 }. 

C10.5-01 is a quip. The display text is "'It's especially bad this year, though,' says Ava.  'Must be a new cook.  Or maybe someone decided that fake sugar would be better for our health than real sugar.'

'Yeah,' says Stacy, rolling her eyes, 'because we all need to go on diets.  They didn't have to put it in everything, though.'"

C10.5-02 is a quip. The display text is "'Daniel always finishes everything on his plate whether he likes it or not,' says Stacy.

'My folks hate to see food go to waste.  Mom always said to either finish everything, or take a little less.'

'If everything tasted like the food here, I wouldn't take any at all!'"


C10.2 done and C10.3 done are truth states that vary. 

To say C10.2 ends tree: now C10.2 done is true.
To say C10.3 ends tree: now C10.3 done is true.

To decide whether a fired quip is listed in (L - a list of objects):
	repeat with X running through L:  [loop on L, as it's almost certainly guaranteed to be smaller than D]
		if X is a fired quip, yes;
	no.

Last after firing a quip (called Q) when C10.2 done is true and Q is not a transitional quip (this is the should we fire C10.6 rule):  [10.2, a truth state, moved into rule header for performance]
	unless C10.3 done is true, make no decision;
	unless a fired quip is listed in the response of C10.1, make no decision; 
	unless a fired quip is listed in the response of C10.4, make no decision;  
	unless a fired quip is listed in the response of C10.5, make no decision;
	say Stacy quips C10.6.

[Understand "puzzle 10" as a mistake ("[conv stat]") when in chapter 10. To say conv stat: 
	unless a fired quip is listed in the response of C10.1, say "1."; 
	unless C10.2 done is true, say "2.";
	unless C10.3 done is true, say "3.";
	unless a fired quip is listed in the response of C10.4, say "4.";  
	unless a fired quip is listed in the response of C10.5, say "5.";]

C10.6 is a quip. The display text is "'Okay, campers!  Enough breakfast!'  It's one of the counselors, Michelle Close.  She bustles along, hurrying everyone on to prepare for the upcoming exhibition and the end-of-camp banquet afterwards.  'You don't have to finish everything on your plates if you don't want to,' she says generously, as Lucian attempts to gobble down the last of his breakfast.  'I know it's pretty awful.'

'Hopefully the banquet will be better,' mutters Stacy.

'It's catered by other people, in town.  After two weeks of this rubbish, I'm sure you won't want to miss the food at tonight's banquet!'

'Awesome!' says Lucian, pushing away his plate.

As everyone gets up from the table, you are suddenly hit with a strong sense of anticipation practically bouncing out of your friends and smashing heavily into your head.  Michelle notices your momentary unsteadiness.  'Hey ... Daniel, right?  You okay?'

'Yeah ... yeah.  Stood up to quickly, that's all.'  Dr Rose did say that you might get flashes like this in the future, and that she would help you out if they didn't go away again.  Better not tell Michelle this: you don't want to wind up being stared at any more than you already are, and then there's Aidan to worry about....

But, as the emotion fades away, you know that this isn't over yet.  Not by a long shot...."

After firing C10.6, end the story finally saying "The End".
