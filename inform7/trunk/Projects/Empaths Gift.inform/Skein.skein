Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls "your girlfriends", much to your embarrassment) are here again.  You spent yesterday catching up on the news in between options and classes, and now you're settling in with the smug sensation of not being a raw newbie any more.&#x000A;&#x000A;The LEAP summer camp isn't quite the same as most summer camps.  LEAP is an acronym for "Learning Enrichment Activity Program"; the brainchild of world-renowned educator Professor Damon Rose, it is housed on the campus of the University of Colorado at Valmont, and was created for Gifted and Talented Kids (gosh, that sounds impressive) to expand their horizons and encourage them to stretch their mental capabilities.&#x000A;&#x000A;Whatever. That's all in the promotional flyers. You just know that you're in for two weeks of the sort of interesting classes you don't get in school, and a bunch of fun options with which to fill up the free time after classes.  This evening, for instance, you've signed up for a scavenger hunt....&#x000A;&#x000A;LEAP, Day 2.  Evening.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Okay, kids!" Michelle, the counselor in charge of the scavenger hunt option waves her hands to settle the crowd around you, before finally remembering her whistle.  A brief fweep sweeps through the room.  "Okay, does everyone have their list?  Everyone good?  Okay!  You have until 8:25 pm to find everything on your lists, return here, and show me your lists so I can check them.  So synchronize your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.  Everyone except you: there's a sudden pressure in the back of your throat, and you feel dizzy ... it only lasts a moment, but by then everyone else is gone, leaving you alone.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Empath's Gift&#x000A;The Empath's Gift by Textfyre&#x000A;Copyright 2010 by Textfyre&#x000A;Designed by Paul O'Brian&#x000A;Written by Christopher Huang&#x000A;Game Engine (FyreVM) by Jesse McGrew&#x000A;Inform 7 Programming by Ron Newcomb and Graeme Jefferis&#x000A;Testing by Paul O'Brian, Christopher Huang, and Eric Eve&#x000A;Special thanks to Graham Nelson and Emily Short&#x000A;for all of their hard work on Inform 7.&#x000A;All rights reserved.&#x000A;&#x000A;Info Desk&#x000A;The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;Michelle Close leans against the side of the desk, chewing on a pencil.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

This is the Rap Session option, you think.&#x000A;&#x000A;As you enter the area, you experience a momentary headache and the urge to sneeze.  The feeling disappears quickly, but evidently not quickly enough because Aidan clearly seems to have noticed something wrong.

The courtyard downstairs is way more pleasant.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Eggdrop option is busy tossing boxes of eggs over the parapet: a table has been set up as well, and is covered with artsy-craftsy materials with which a number of campers are building egg-preservation containers.&#x000A;&#x000A;As you emerge into the sunlight, you feel a momentary dizziness that makes you almost want to hurl.

The other university buildings are visIble beyond the treetops, and the blank north face of Jacobs Hall rises up to the south; paths southeast and southwest lead around Jacobs Hall, though there is no entrance to the building from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;A box-like object crashes into the concrete close to the wall of Jacobs Hall.

Jacobs Hall is back to the west, and the dining hall is to the east.  A fountain takes up space right where all the paths meet, so there usually aren't that many people running around and tearing up the grass.  Right now, though, there are several people running around, playing Myth Tag, and there's nothing the fountain can do about it.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[30] w&#x000A;You leave behind the bright sunshine.&#x000A;&#x000A;Info Desk&#x000A;The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.

(finding a hat)]&#x000A;&#x000A;Michelle takes your list, then searches about herself for a pencil (completely missing the one behind her ear and the two pens in her pocket) before finally pulling out a magic marker.  She nods as she ticks off the items from the list.  "Nice going, Daniel," she says, smiling, "that's everything on the list.  You win!"  She slaps a blue ribbon on your chest and turns to address the next camper.&#x000A;&#x000A;The numb sensation in the side of your head takes a few moments to clear completely.&#x000A;&#x000A;Well, that was odd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Those sudden flashes of sensory hallucination (what else would you call them?) seem to die down over the course of the next day.  The headaches and dizzy spells are so mild now as to be practically gone, but on the other hand, the frequency seems to be increasing.  It's all somewhere in the back of your head: if you focus, you can almost always find... something.  A smell, or a sound that isn't there.  A peculiar flavor hanging in the air.&#x000A;&#x000A;Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.  You could talk to Aidan, but he'd probably just march you straight up to the hospital.  He'd even carry you there if he had to.  So where does that leave you?&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;LEAP, Day 3 (Tuesday) - Dorm Time&#x000A;&#x000A;Your roommate, Jeremy, went off with some friends after dinner, which leaves you alone for now.  It's dorm time, which means you have maybe a couple of hours or so before lights-out, all to yourself.  Some people spend the time reading, or listening to music, or visiting friends.  Which reminds you, maybe talking to Stacy and Ava about this would be the best thing to do.  Maybe they'll tell you it's all part of being eleven years old, or something.&#x000A;&#x000A;Yeah.  You can hope.&#x000A;&#x000A;[A new goal was added: visit Ava &amp; Stacy]&#x000A;&#x000A;Your Room&#x000A;You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooler.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">It's your second year at the LEAP summer camp, and so far it's been as great as you remember last year to have been.  Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls "your girlfriends", much to your embarrassment) are here again.  You spent yesterday catching up on the news in between options and classes, and now you're settling in with the smug sensation of not being a raw newbie any more.&#x000A;&#x000A;The LEAP summer camp isn't quite the same as most summer camps.  LEAP is an acronym for "Learning Enrichment Activity Program"; the brainchild of world-renowned educator Professor Damon Rose, it is housed on the campus of the University of Colorado at Valmont, and was created for Gifted and Talented Kids (gosh, that sounds impressive) to expand their horizons and encourage them to stretch their mental capabilities.&#x000A;&#x000A;Whatever. That's all in the promotional flyers. You just know that you're in for two weeks of the sort of interesting classes you don't get in school, and a bunch of fun options with which to fill up the free time after classes.  This evening, for instance, you've signed up for a scavenger hunt....&#x000A;LEAP, Day 2.  Evening.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Okay, kids!" Michelle, the counselor in charge of the scavenger hunt option waves her hands to settle the crowd around you, before finally remembering her whistle.  A brief fweep sweeps through the room.  "Okay, does everyone have their list?  Everyone good?  Okay!  You have until 8:25 pm to find everything on your lists, return here, and show me your lists so I can check them.  So synchronize your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.  Everyone except you: there's a sudden pressure in the back of your throat, and you feel dizzy ... it only lasts a moment, but by then everyone else is gone, leaving you alone.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Empath's Gift&#x000A;The Empath's Gift by Textfyre&#x000A;Copyright 2010 by Textfyre&#x000A;Designed by Paul O'Brian&#x000A;Written by Christopher Huang&#x000A;Game Engine (FyreVM) by Jesse McGrew&#x000A;Inform 7 Programming by Ron Newcomb and Graeme Jefferis&#x000A;Testing by Paul O'Brian, Christopher Huang, and Eric Eve&#x000A;Special thanks to Graham Nelson and Emily Short&#x000A;for all of their hard work on Inform 7.&#x000A;All rights reserved.&#x000A;&#x000A;Info Desk&#x000A;The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.

A fountain takes up space right where all the paths meet, so there usually aren't that many people running around and tearing up the grass.  Right now, though, there are several people running around, playing Myth Tag, and there's nothing the fountain can do about it.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[31] w&#x000A;You leave behind the bright sunshine.&#x000A;&#x000A;Info Desk&#x000A;The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.

She slaps a blue ribbon on your chest and turns to address the next camper.&#x000A;&#x000A;The numb sensation in the side of your head takes a few moments to clear completely.&#x000A;&#x000A;Well, that was odd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Those sudden flashes of sensory hallucination (what else would you call them?) seem to die down over the course of the next day.  The headaches and dizzy spells are so mild now as to be practically gone, but on the other hand, the frequency seems to be increasing.  It's all somewhere in the back of your head: if you focus, you can almost always find... something.  A smell, or a sound that isn't there.  A peculiar flavor hanging in the air.&#x000A;&#x000A;Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.

It's dorm time, which means you have maybe a couple of hours or so before lights-out, all to yourself.  Some people spend the time reading, or listening to music, or visiting friends.  Which reminds you, maybe talking to Stacy and Ava about this would be the best thing to do.  Maybe they'll tell you it's all part of being eleven years old, or something.&#x000A;&#x000A;Yeah.  You can hope.&#x000A;&#x000A;[A new goal was added: visit Ava &amp; Stacy]&#x000A;&#x000A;Your Room&#x000A;You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooler.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[33] test 2&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[34] teleport to your room&#x000A;[Asserted being at your room.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[35] n&#x000A;You step out of the room, locking it behind you.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pits, East&#x000A;Your room is at this end of the Pits hallway, just to the south of here.

And at the end of the corridor is, of course, the window overlooking Calvin Field, and stardom continues back to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[38] knock&#x000A;Ava peeks out and breaks into a smile when she sees you.  "Hey, Daniel!"  She pulls you inside.  "What's up?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava And Stacy's Room&#x000A;Ava and Stacy both keep their respective sides of the room perfectly tidy; it's rather intimidating, actually.  You can tell whose side is whose by the stuff they keep on their desks: Ava has a CD player, an assortment of CDs, and a few books; Stacy has a few broken gadgets that she's fixing, probably because she broke them to begin with.  One of them has taped a poster for "Casablanca" on the door to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;Stacy looks up from her desk, where a few hundred tiny electronic parts are scattered.  "We were just talking about how lately you seem distracted all the time.  Is something wrong?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava looks a little embarrassed.  "We're just concerned.  You know."&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "I don't know what's happening...."&#x000A;2. "Well, I'm getting these headaches...."&#x000A;3. "There's nothing wrong.  Can't a guy visit his friends every now and then?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[39] 1&#x000A;"I don't know what's happening...."&#x000A;&#x000A;You tell Ava and Stacy about the headaches, the dizzy spells, and the hallucinations.  Only of course you don't call them hallucinations, because they'd think you're going nuts for sure.  Ava says, "that sounds serious.  Maybe you should see a doctor."&#x000A;&#x000A;[You achieved a goal! (visit Ava &amp; Stacy)]&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "Over my dead body."&#x000A;2.

And we've noticed you sometimes stopping in the hallway with your eyes sort of glazed over."&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "Is it that obvious?"&#x000A;2. "Have you two been spying on me?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[41] 1&#x000A;"Is it that obvious?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Mostly to Ava," says Stacy, "because Ava notices these things.  I would have totally missed it if she hadn't pointed it out as we were coming back from dinner earlier."  You remember feeling a little nauseous as you walked by the info desk.  You thought it might have been something you ate.  "Personally," Stacy continues, "I'm kind of wondering if maybe it could be real.  The sounds and stuff you told us about, I mean."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava frowns.  "Stacy, how can it possibly be real?  Nobody else noticed anything."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Nobody else noticed Daniel getting all glassy-eyed and green either.  Look, Daniel, there's a very easy way to find out.  If there's something at the info desk that's making you sick, then going there again will bring back the same feeling, right?  So we could just go there and see how consistent these feelings are."&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "They're pretty consistent, now I think about it.  Always at the same place... sort of.  I mean, unless something's changed about the place since."&#x000A;2. "Consistent? They're just random.  I never know when I'm going to suddenly get this feeling, whatever it is."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[42] 1&#x000A;"They're pretty consistent, now I think about it.  Always at the same place... sort of.  I mean, unless something's changed about the place since."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava looks thoughtful.  "It could be some sort of allergy, I suppose.  Maybe we could find out exactly what's causing this, and fix it."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Okay, then!"  Stacy grins cheerfully as she pulls a deerstalker cap out of her dresser.  "I'd say we have a mystery to solve."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava gets out a notebook and pen.  "Just try to focus, Daniel.  We'll get to the bottom of this."&#x000A;&#x000A;[A new goal was added: investigate odd sensations]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[43] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Second Floor Rooms, East&#x000A;The girls at this end of the corridor seem to prefer movie posters to cutouts of actors.

Frankenstein's monster looms over the doorway to the south, as if standing guard outside the Pits lobby, while werewolves and vampires romp away to the east and west.  The stairs themselves lead back upstairs to the wintery delights of the first floor.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  &#x000A;&#x000A;"Daniel," says Ava, "Daniel, you're getting that funny look again.

From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  &#x000A;&#x000A;Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[48] focus&#x000A;Concentrating on the flavor, you sense an undercurrent of salt tears.  They trail off to the east, but seem strongest around one of the doors to the south. &#x000A;&#x000A;"Whatever it is, it's strongest around that door."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava and Stacy exchange glances, and before you can stop her, Stacy is knocking on the door.  "We've come this far.  I want to know what's at the end of --"&#x000A;&#x000A;Stacy quickly shuts up when the door opens a crack, and a rather timid little guy peeks out at you.  He fairly reeks of that mysterious sour-salty air.  And now you think you can hear some sort of twittering in the background, too.  It occurs to you that you remember seeing him up at the egg-drop option yesterday, though he certainly wasn't giving off this... whatever it is... back then.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hi," says Ava, who seems to recognize the guy.  "Lucian, isn't it?  We met yesterday at the sign-ups.  Anyway, these are my friends Daniel and Stacy.  May we come in for a moment?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Lucian lets the door swing half-open and sighs resignedly.  "Sure, if you want," he says, retreating back into the room.  The three of you follow him inside.&#x000A;&#x000A;Lucian's Room&#x000A;It's another dorm room, not much different from your own.  Lucian's desk and bed are on one side; a CD player, playing Bill Withers' "Lean On Me" over and over, sits on his desk beside a couple of framed photographs.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  &#x000A;&#x000A;[placeholder text: "Room description text about Lucian"]&#x000A;&#x000A;.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] ask lucian about leap&#x000A;There is no reply.&#x000A;&#x000A;[You achieved a goal!

So why don't you just spit it out and get it over with?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Lucian looks a little angry and says, "Stop picking on me!  You're just like those bullies at dinner!

The glamour continues east and west, to where the younger girl campers are roomed, while the stairs go up and down.&#x000A;&#x000A;A few tables have been set up here for the RPG option, and the campers involved seem thoroughly absorbed in the unfolding story.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[23] d&#x000A;&#x000A;First Floor Midpoint&#x000A;The first floor is where the older boys, including your brother Aidan, are housed.  The walls are plastered with images of winter sports, which makes perfect sense given that it's the middle of summer.  Between the skiers and the snowboarders, the hallway continues east and west, while the main stairs go up to the girls' dorms and down to the younger boys' dorms; and of course there's the info desk back to the south.  A friendly-looking cardboard cutout of Olympic ski champion Stephan Eberharter holds a pouch full of cutouts of all things winter-sporty, practically begging you to stick more of them up on the walls.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[24] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Info Desk&#x000A;The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.

Jacobs Hall -- the old part, anyway -- is open to the east, and its front lawn spreads out to the southeast.  You can also go northeast, squeezing around the newer part of Jacobs Hall to the courtyard beyond.&#x000A;&#x000A;Conveniently, a bus shelter with a newspaper vending machine is almost directly outside the Hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[26] put change in machine&#x000A;You insert the appropriate change, and the glass front of the vending machine clicks open just wide enough for you to extract the day's newspaper.  Then it snaps shut again.&#x000A;&#x000A;[You achieved a goal!

It's not terribly interesting, but Aidan sometimes comes here to play basketball with his friends, as if the camp counselors didn't make you all run around enough already.  The other university buildings are visIble beyond the treetops, and the blank north face of Jacobs Hall rises up to the south; paths southeast and southwest lead around Jacobs Hall, though there is no entrance to the building from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[29] get grass&#x000A;You briefly consider the trees, but they're rather on the tall side.  Then you reach into the bushes and immediately back off thanks to the thorns.  Finally, you settle on just grabbing a few blades of grass.&#x000A;&#x000A;[You achieved a goal!

Jacobs Hall is back to the west, and the dining hall is to the east.  A fountain takes up space right where all the paths meet, so there usually aren't that many people running around and tearing up the grass.  Right now, though, there are several people running around, playing Myth Tag, and there's nothing the fountain can do about it.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[31] w&#x000A;You leave behind the bright sunshine.&#x000A;&#x000A;Info Desk&#x000A;The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.

Or a hat, one of the two: you never did figure out how to make those two things any different from each other.&#x000A;&#x000A;[You achieved a goal! (finding a hat)]&#x000A;&#x000A;Michelle takes your list, then searches about herself for a pencil (completely missing the one behind her ear and the two pens in her pocket) before finally pulling out a magic marker.  She nods as she ticks off the items from the list.  "Nice going, Daniel," she says, smiling, "that's everything on the list.  You win!"  She slaps a blue ribbon on your chest and turns to address the next camper.&#x000A;&#x000A;The numb sensation in the side of your head takes a few moments to clear completely.&#x000A;&#x000A;Well, that was odd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Those sudden flashes of sensory hallucination (what else would you call them?) seem to die down over the course of the next day.  The headaches and dizzy spells are so mild now as to be practically gone, but on the other hand, the frequency seems to be increasing.  It's all somewhere in the back of your head: if you focus, you can almost always find... something.  A smell, or a sound that isn't there.  A peculiar flavor hanging in the air.&#x000A;&#x000A;Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.  You could talk to Aidan, but he'd probably just march you straight up to the hospital.  He'd even carry you there if he had to.  So where does that leave you?&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;LEAP, Day 3 (Tuesday) - Dorm Time&#x000A;&#x000A;Your roommate, Jeremy, went off with some friends after dinner, which leaves you alone for now.  It's dorm time, which means you have maybe a couple of hours or so before lights-out, all to yourself.  Some people spend the time reading, or listening to music, or visiting friends.  Which reminds you, maybe talking to Stacy and Ava about this would be the best thing to do.  Maybe they'll tell you it's all part of being eleven years old, or something.&#x000A;&#x000A;Yeah.  You can hope.&#x000A;&#x000A;[A new goal was added: visit Ava &amp; Stacy]&#x000A;&#x000A;Your Room&#x000A;You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooler.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[33] test 2&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[34] teleport to your room&#x000A;[Asserted being at your room.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[35] n&#x000A;You step out of the room, locking it behind you.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pits, East&#x000A;Your room is at this end of the Pits hallway, just to the south of here.  You've elected to cover your door with the biggest cutout of a werewolf that you can find, because werewolves are cool.  The hallway continues west, and a high window on the east wall looks out across Calvin Field North.  Right beside your room door is the fire stair leading back upstairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[36] u&#x000A;&#x000A;First Floor Rooms, East&#x000A;This is the east end of the first floor dorm area.  Through the window at the end of the hall, you can see Calvin Field North and a bunch of campers running about in the summer sunshine.  In here, you are surrounded by images of people having snowball fights.  The fire stairs at this end of the hall go up and down.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[37] u&#x000A;&#x000A;Second Floor Rooms, East&#x000A;The girls at this end of the corridor seem to prefer movie posters to cutouts of actors.  The only cutout here is a life-size Humphrey Bogart, on the door to the fire stairs.  Opposite Bogey, to the north, is Ava and Stacy's room, while behind Bogey are stairs going up and down.  And at the end of the corridor is, of course, the window overlooking Calvin Field, and stardom continues back to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[38] knock&#x000A;Ava peeks out and breaks into a smile when she sees you.  "Hey, Daniel!"  She pulls you inside.  "What's up?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava And Stacy's Room&#x000A;Ava and Stacy both keep their respective sides of the room perfectly tidy; it's rather intimidating, actually.  You can tell whose side is whose by the stuff they keep on their desks: Ava has a CD player, an assortment of CDs, and a few books; Stacy has a few broken gadgets that she's fixing, probably because she broke them to begin with.  One of them has taped a poster for "Casablanca" on the door to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;Stacy looks up from her desk, where a few hundred tiny electronic parts are scattered.  "We were just talking about how lately you seem distracted all the time.  Is something wrong?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava looks a little embarrassed.  "We're just concerned.  You know."&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "I don't know what's happening...."&#x000A;2. "Well, I'm getting these headaches...."&#x000A;3. "There's nothing wrong.  Can't a guy visit his friends every now and then?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[39] 1&#x000A;"I don't know what's happening...."&#x000A;&#x000A;You tell Ava and Stacy about the headaches, the dizzy spells, and the hallucinations.  Only of course you don't call them hallucinations, because they'd think you're going nuts for sure.  Ava says, "that sounds serious.  Maybe you should see a doctor."&#x000A;&#x000A;[You achieved a goal! (visit Ava &amp; Stacy)]&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "Over my dead body."&#x000A;2. "I'm not that sick."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[40] 2&#x000A;"I'm not that sick."&#x000A;&#x000A;"That's what they all say," says Stacy, "right before they keel over dead."&#x000A;&#x000A;"I don't know," says Ava, "it sounds pretty serious to me.  And we've noticed you sometimes stopping in the hallway with your eyes sort of glazed over."&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "Is it that obvious?"&#x000A;2. "Have you two been spying on me?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[41] 1&#x000A;"Is it that obvious?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Mostly to Ava," says Stacy, "because Ava notices these things.  I would have totally missed it if she hadn't pointed it out as we were coming back from dinner earlier."  You remember feeling a little nauseous as you walked by the info desk.  You thought it might have been something you ate.  "Personally," Stacy continues, "I'm kind of wondering if maybe it could be real.  The sounds and stuff you told us about, I mean."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava frowns.  "Stacy, how can it possibly be real?  Nobody else noticed anything."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Nobody else noticed Daniel getting all glassy-eyed and green either.  Look, Daniel, there's a very easy way to find out.  If there's something at the info desk that's making you sick, then going there again will bring back the same feeling, right?  So we could just go there and see how consistent these feelings are."&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "They're pretty consistent, now I think about it.  Always at the same place... sort of.  I mean, unless something's changed about the place since."&#x000A;2. "Consistent? They're just random.  I never know when I'm going to suddenly get this feeling, whatever it is."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[42] 1&#x000A;"They're pretty consistent, now I think about it.  Always at the same place... sort of.  I mean, unless something's changed about the place since."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava looks thoughtful.  "It could be some sort of allergy, I suppose.  Maybe we could find out exactly what's causing this, and fix it."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Okay, then!"  Stacy grins cheerfully as she pulls a deerstalker cap out of her dresser.  "I'd say we have a mystery to solve."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava gets out a notebook and pen.  "Just try to focus, Daniel.  We'll get to the bottom of this."&#x000A;&#x000A;[A new goal was added: investigate odd sensations]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[43] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Second Floor Rooms, East&#x000A;The girls at this end of the corridor seem to prefer movie posters to cutouts of actors.

The stairs themselves lead back upstairs to the wintery delights of the first floor.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  &#x000A;&#x000A;"Daniel," says Ava, "Daniel, you're getting that funny look again.

From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  &#x000A;&#x000A;Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[48] focus&#x000A;Concentrating on the flavor, you sense an undercurrent of salt tears.  They trail off to the east, but seem strongest around one of the doors to the south. &#x000A;&#x000A;"Whatever it is, it's strongest around that door."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava and Stacy exchange glances, and before you can stop her, Stacy is knocking on the door.  "We've come this far.  I want to know what's at the end of --"&#x000A;&#x000A;Stacy quickly shuts up when the door opens a crack, and a rather timid little guy peeks out at you.  He fairly reeks of that mysterious sour-salty air.  And now you think you can hear some sort of twittering in the background, too.  It occurs to you that you remember seeing him up at the egg-drop option yesterday, though he certainly wasn't giving off this... whatever it is... back then.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hi," says Ava, who seems to recognize the guy.  "Lucian, isn't it?  We met yesterday at the sign-ups.  Anyway, these are my friends Daniel and Stacy.  May we come in for a moment?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Lucian lets the door swing half-open and sighs resignedly.  "Sure, if you want," he says, retreating back into the room.  The three of you follow him inside.&#x000A;&#x000A;Lucian's Room&#x000A;It's another dorm room, not much different from your own.  Lucian's desk and bed are on one side; a CD player, playing Bill Withers' "Lean On Me" over and over, sits on his desk beside a couple of framed photographs.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  &#x000A;&#x000A;[placeholder text: "Room description text about Lucian"]&#x000A;&#x000A;.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] ask lucian about leap&#x000A;There is no reply.&#x000A;&#x000A;[You achieved a goal!

So why don't you just spit it out and get it over with?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Lucian looks a little angry and says, "Stop picking on me!  You're just like those bullies at dinner!  They made me give them my grandmother's earth crystal and I bet you want me to pay some sort of fine for being a loser.  Well I've had it.  Just go away and leave me alone!"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[51] ask lucian about crystal&#x000A;"I don't want to talk about that any more."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[52] 2&#x000A;That's not a verb I recognize.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[53] ask lucian about family&#x000A;Lucian rolls his eyes.

(finding a newspaper)]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[26] get paper&#x000A;You already have that.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[27] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Courtyard&#x000A;The courtyard is a hard, concrete square ringed by bushes and trees.  It's not terribly interesting, but Aidan sometimes comes here to play basketball with his friends, as if the camp counselors didn't make you all run around enough already.  The other university buildings are visIble beyond the treetops, and the blank north face of Jacobs Hall rises up to the south; paths southeast and southwest lead around Jacobs Hall, though there is no entrance to the building from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;A box-like object crashes into the concrete close to the wall of Jacobs Hall.  Raw egg comes splattering out of its side, accompanied by loud groans from above.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[28] get grass&#x000A;You briefly consider the trees, but they're rather on the tall side.  Then you reach into the bushes and immediately back off thanks to the thorns.  Finally, you settle on just grabbing a few blades of grass.&#x000A;&#x000A;[You achieved a goal! (finding something that was once alive)]&#x000A;&#x000A;A box-like object crashes into the Concrete close to the wall of Jacobs Hall, and lies still.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[29] se&#x000A;&#x000A;Calvin Field, North&#x000A;Claremont Hall, to the north, looms over the entire length of Calvin Field, which continues to the south.  Jacobs Hall is back to the west, and the dining hall is to the east.  A fountain takes up space right where all the paths meet, so there usually aren't that many people running around and tearing up the grass.  Right now, though, there are several people running around, playing Myth Tag, and there's nothing the fountain can do about it.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[30] w&#x000A;You leave behind the bright sunshine.&#x000A;&#x000A;Info Desk&#x000A;The main foyer of Jacobs Hall still looks a bit like the inside of a hundred-year-old mansion, though it's been a little bit beat up by the passing generations of students.  The information desk, an anomaly in glass and polished steel, sits beneath a portrait of Alexander Quaverley Jacobs, facing the main entrance to the west.  To the east, wide double doors open onto Calvin Field, while arches go south and southeast to the rest of the lobby area.  Much of the north wall has been chewed through to make a connection to the newer part of Jacobs Hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;Michelle Close leans against the side of the desk, chewing on a pencil.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[31] fold paper&#x000A;You pull out a section of the newspaper and quickly fold it into a sailboat.  Or a hat, one of the two: you never did figure out how to make those two things any different from each other.&#x000A;&#x000A;[You achieved a goal! (finding a hat)]&#x000A;&#x000A;Michelle takes your list, then searches about herself for a pencil (completely missing the one behind her ear and the two pens in her pocket) before finally pulling out a magic marker.  She nods as she ticks off the items from the list.  "Nice going, Daniel," she says, smiling, "that's everything on the list.  You win!"  She slaps a blue ribbon on your chest and turns to address the next camper.&#x000A;&#x000A;The numb sensation in the side of your head takes a few moments to clear completely.&#x000A;&#x000A;Well, that was odd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Those sudden flashes of sensory hallucination (what else would you call them?) seem to die down over the course of the next day.  The headaches and dizzy spells are so mild now as to be practically gone, but on the other hand, the frequency seems to be increasing.  It's all somewhere in the back of your head: if you focus, you can almost always find... something.  A smell, or a sound that isn't there.  A peculiar flavor hanging in the air.&#x000A;&#x000A;Even so, you're not entirely sure you want to speak to a doctor.  I mean, it's not as if it's laying you flat on your back on anything like that.  You could talk to Aidan, but he'd probably just march you straight up to the hospital.  He'd even carry you there if he had to.  So where does that leave you?&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;LEAP, Day 3 (Tuesday) - Dorm Time&#x000A;&#x000A;Your roommate, Jeremy, went off with some friends after dinner, which leaves you alone for now.  It's dorm time, which means you have maybe a couple of hours or so before lights-out, all to yourself.  Some people spend the time reading, or listening to music, or visiting friends.  Which reminds you, maybe talking to Stacy and Ava about this would be the best thing to do.  Maybe they'll tell you it's all part of being eleven years old, or something.&#x000A;&#x000A;Yeah.  You can hope.&#x000A;&#x000A;[A new goal was added: visit Ava &amp; Stacy]&#x000A;&#x000A;Your Room&#x000A;You share this room with first-year camper Jeremy Dolan, who hates werewolves for some inexplicable reason.  He let you put the werewolf cutout on the outside of the door only because you let him put up a vampire cutout on the inside.  Jeremy's not around right now, though, so you'll have to wait before continuing your ongoing discussion as to whether vampires or werewolves are cooler.  In the meantime, there's your bed and your desk, and the door back to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

And at the end of the corridor is, of course, the window overlooking Calvin Field, and stardom continues back to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[5] knock&#x000A;Ava peeks out and breaks into a smile when she sees you.  "Hey, Daniel!"  She pulls you inside.  "What's up?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava And Stacy's Room&#x000A;Ava and Stacy both keep their respective sides of the room perfectly tidy; it's rather intimidating, actually.  You can tell whose side is whose by the stuff they keep on their desks: Ava has a CD player, an assortment of CDs, and a few books; Stacy has a few broken gadgets that she's fixing, probably because she broke them to begin with.  One of them has taped a poster for "Casablanca" on the door to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;Stacy looks up from her desk, where a few hundred tiny electronic parts are scattered.  "We were just talking about how lately you seem distracted all the time.  Is something wrong?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava looks a little embarrassed.  "We're just concerned.  You know."&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "I don't know what's happening...."&#x000A;2. "Well, I'm getting these headaches...."&#x000A;3. "There's nothing wrong.  Can't a guy visit his friends every now and then?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[6] 1&#x000A;"I don't know what's happening...."&#x000A;&#x000A;You tell Ava and Stacy about the headaches, the dizzy spells, and the hallucinations.  Only of course you don't call them hallucinations, because they'd think you're going nuts for sure.  Ava says, "that sounds serious.  Maybe you should see a doctor."&#x000A;&#x000A;[You achieved a goal! (visit Ava &amp; Stacy)]&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "Over my dead body."&#x000A;2. "I'm not that sick."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] 2&#x000A;"I'm not that sick."&#x000A;&#x000A;"That's what they all say," says Stacy, "right before they keel over dead."&#x000A;&#x000A;"I don't know," says Ava, "it sounds pretty serious to me.  And we've noticed you sometimes stopping in the hallway with your eyes sort of glazed over."&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "Is it that obvious?"&#x000A;2. "Have you two been spying on me?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] 1&#x000A;"Is it that obvious?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Mostly to Ava," says Stacy, "because Ava notices these things.  I would have totally missed it if she hadn't pointed it out as we were coming back from dinner earlier."  You remember feeling a little nauseous as you walked by the info desk.  You thought it might have been something you ate.  "Personally," Stacy continues, "I'm kind of wondering if maybe it could be real.  The sounds and stuff you told us about, I mean."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava frowns.  "Stacy, how can it possibly be real?  Nobody else noticed anything."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Nobody else noticed Daniel getting all glassy-eyed and green either.  Look, Daniel, there's a very easy way to find out.  If there's something at the info desk that's making you sick, then going there again will bring back the same feeling, right?  So we could just go there and see how consistent these feelings are."&#x000A;&#x000A;1. "They're pretty consistent, now I think about it.  Always at the same place... sort of.  I mean, unless something's changed about the place since."&#x000A;2. "Consistent? They're just random.  I never know when I'm going to suddenly get this feeling, whatever it is."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] 1&#x000A;"They're pretty consistent, now I think about it.  Always at the same place... sort of.  I mean, unless something's changed about the place since."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava looks thoughtful.  "It could be some sort of allergy, I suppose.  Maybe we could find out exactly what's causing this, and fix it."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Okay, then!"  Stacy grins cheerfully as she pulls a deerstalker cap out of her dresser.  "I'd say we have a mystery to solve."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava gets out a notebook and pen.  "Just try to focus, Daniel.  We'll get to the bottom of this."&#x000A;&#x000A;[A new goal was added: investigate odd sensations]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Second Floor Rooms, East&#x000A;The girls at this end of the corridor seem to prefer movie posters to cutouts of actors.

The stairs themselves lead back upstairs to the wintery delights of the first floor.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  &#x000A;&#x000A;"Daniel," says Ava, "Daniel, you're getting that funny look again.

From here, you could also go back east to the main stairwell, or take the fire stairs upstairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  &#x000A;&#x000A;Ava and Stacy trail along behind you. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] focus&#x000A;Concentrating on the flavor, you sense an undercurrent of salt tears.  They trail off to the east, but seem strongest around one of the doors to the south. &#x000A;&#x000A;"Whatever it is, it's strongest around that door."&#x000A;&#x000A;Ava and Stacy exchange glances, and before you can stop her, Stacy is knocking on the door.  "We've come this far.  I want to know what's at the end of --"&#x000A;&#x000A;Stacy quickly shuts up when the door opens a crack, and a rather timid little guy peeks out at you.  He fairly reeks of that mysterious sour-salty air.  And now you think you can hear some sort of twittering in the background, too.  It occurs to you that you remember seeing him up at the egg-drop option yesterday, though he certainly wasn't giving off this... whatever it is... back then.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hi," says Ava, who seems to recognize the guy.  "Lucian, isn't it?  We met yesterday at the sign-ups.  Anyway, these are my friends Daniel and Stacy.  May we come in for a moment?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Lucian lets the door swing half-open and sighs resignedly.  "Sure, if you want," he says, retreating back into the room.  The three of you follow him inside.&#x000A;&#x000A;Lucian's Room&#x000A;It's another dorm room, not much different from your own.  Lucian's desk and bed are on one side; a CD player, playing Bill Withers' "Lean On Me" over and over, sits on his desk beside a couple of framed photographs.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a sour, vaguely nauseating taste in the air.  &#x000A;&#x000A;[placeholder text: "Room description text about Lucian"]&#x000A;&#x000A;.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] ask lucian about leap&#x000A;There is no reply.&#x000A;&#x000A;[You achieved a goal!

Stacy looks a little annoyed and says, "you know, if you don't tell us what's upsetting you, we can't help you.  So why don't you just spit it out and get it over with?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Lucian looks a little angry and says, "Stop picking on me!  You're just like those bullies at dinner!  They made me give them my grandmother's earth crystal and I bet you want me to pay some sort of fine for being a loser.  Well I've had it.  Just go away and leave me alone!"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[18] ask lucian about crystal&#x000A;"I don't want to talk about that any more."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] 2&#x000A;That's not a verb I recognize.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] ask lucian about family&#x000A;Lucian rolls his eyes.

Ava Winters and Stacy Alexander, whom you met last year (and whom your brother Aidan calls "your girlfriends", much to your embarrassment) are here again.

So synchronize your watches... are we all in sync?  Good!  Your time starts... now!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Michelle's whistle gives another sharp fweep, and the room practically empties as everyone else runs off to begin their hunt.

    <result xml:space="preserve">First Floor Lobby, East&#x000A;This used to be a rather large dining room, once upon a time, and it still has a low-hanging chandelier right in the middle of the ceiling.  A piano's been pushed under the chandelier so that nobody accidentally gets a head full of crystal walking blindly around, and the place is generally used as a kind of music room now.  The info desk is back to the northwest, and to the west is the rest of the first floor lobby.  Wide picture windows look out on the front lawn and on the southern part of Calvin Field. The School of Rock option is in progress here, jamming away in the upper decibels.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
