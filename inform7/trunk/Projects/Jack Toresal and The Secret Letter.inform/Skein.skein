Servants from the aristocratic districts and villagers from outside Toresal crush themselves into the maze of stalls and stretched canvas, hoping to beat the noontime heat and get the farmers' produce while it's still fresh. The press of bodies, the din of haggling and bargains struck - it all makes getting around unnoticed easier, although not necessarily more pleasant. No fewer than half a dozen stall-gazing bumpkins have trod on your feet already this morning. You've kept your mouth shut, though. People remember an urchin who gives lip.&#x000A;&#x000A;"See anything you like?" asks the silk seller, with a teasing smile. You smile back. You couldn't afford the cheapest of her cloaks if you nicked ten purses in a morning, as Teisha well knows.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh, these are much too plain," you scoff, even as you gaze wistfully at the bright colors, the beautiful embroidery. Time for a bit of breakfast, you decide, and anyway if you linger too long, people will wonder what a boy is doing shopping for women's cloaks. "Perhaps I'll come back this afternoon, when you've put out your better wares."&#x000A;&#x000A;Teisha laughs. "Don't be a stranger, Jack."&#x000A;&#x000A;You make your way through the market, nicking an apple from the fruit stall while its owner argues with a fat Easterner over local politics. Everyone seems to be talking politics these days, you've noticed. Everywhere people are heatedly discussing Baron Fossville's tax policies or something called the "Ascension" - whatever that is. Boring stuff, really. Finally you reach a quiet alley where you can catch a breath from the crowds and enjoy your apple in peace.&#x000A;&#x000A;You settle yourself on a crate and take a bite of your apple. Suddenly, from the alley's entrance, you hear voices.&#x000A;Chapter 1 - Grubber's Market&#x000A;Jack Toresal and The Secret Letter&#x000A;Jack Toresal and The Secret Letter by Textfyre, Inc&#x000A;Copyright &#x00A9; 2008 by Textfyre, Inc&#x000A;Designed by David Cornelson and Michael Gentry&#x000A;Written by Michael Gentry&#x000A;Programmed by Graeme Jefferis&#x000A;Testing by Jacqueline A. Lott&#x000A;All rights reserved&#x000A;&#x000A;Alley&#x000A;This narrow alley is tucked away between a storehouse on one side and the canvas wall of a stallkeeper's tent on the other. It serves primarily as somewhere out-of-the-way for stallkeepers to sweep their garbage, so it's not exactly the most pleasant-smelling place in all of Miradania, but at least no one is likely to bother you here. You can leave to the southeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;Several crates are stacked up against the back wall of the alley.&#x000A;&#x000A;A group of people have gathered just outside the alley. You can't quite hear what they're saying from here, but there is a grim, ugly tone to them that speaks of dangerous doings.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

From here you have a good view of the market's northwest junction and Lord's Road leading out of town to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;A group of tough-looking mercenaries has gathered at the Northwest Junction. One of them is barking orders at the others in an angry voice.&#x000A;&#x000A;"...we know he skulks Grubber's most mornings, so spread out quick, cover all streets from the square," growls one of them, evidently the group's leader.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[4] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The leader spits on the dusty ground. "Keep your eyes open and don't take guff. But for the love of Brigid, keep your tempers and your swords covered unless you really need 'em. Ain't bein' paid to toss the locals."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[5] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;"And keep sharp!" the leader snaps. "Remember this is a kid we're lookin' for. Kids move fast, stay out of sight, slip through crowds easy. I find out later he got away under your nose, I'll have it off!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly, that bit of apple you swallowed a minute ago turns into a cold, hard chunk in your belly.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[6] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Now, everyone memorize the description." The leader pulls a dirty, folded bit of parchment from his belt and squints at it. "Shoulder-length brown hair," he reads, haltingly. "Green eyes. Slight of build. Ten, maybe twelve spans high." He holds his hand out flat, at what happens to be exactly your height. "Usually wears a hat and a gray cloak."&#x000A;&#x000A;He refolds the parchment and jams it back into his belt. "You dims got all that?"&#x000A;&#x000A;The others nod.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Okay, go!" barks the leader, and the mercenaries set out in several directions, moving at a brisk walk. Two men go to the north gates and start shoving them closed; the others enter the crowded market and start shoving their way through the suddenly flabbergasted crowds.&#x000A;&#x000A;Your heart sinks. This is definitely not good.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] d&#x000A;As you climb back down the crates, one of them wobbles and your foot slips. You tumble loudly to the cobblestones. "Stupid! Clumsy!" you mutter, scrambling to your feet.&#x000A;&#x000A;From the street, you hear, "What was that? Check the alley!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Two mercenaries rush in and spot you immediately. They approach warily, their arms spread wide.&#x000A;&#x000A;You're in trouble now...&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] se&#x000A;You dash away into the crowd, weaving between customers and pushing your way through the thickest knots of people. The mercenaries pound after you, yelling and shoving people out of their way, but they're too big and too slow, and you quickly manage to lose them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Grubber's Market, Northwest Junction&#x000A;This is the northwest corner of Grubber's Market. You can skirt around the edge of the market to the northeast or south, or head into the thick of it to the east or southeast. A wide, paved road leads north. You can also duck back into the alley to the northwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;The north gates leading to Lord's Road are closed.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] test market&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] xyzzy&#x000A;A hollow voice whispers "groo."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] e&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The stallkeeper" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Candlemaker's Stall&#x000A;The heat and fumes from the candlemaker's tallow pots make this stall an unpleasant place to loiter. Still, people need candles, and customers seem to be buying them as fast as the stall keeper can dip them. Most of the candles are tallow, fast-burning and cheap, but there are also a number of premade wax candles in different colors. Other stalls are to the north, east, west, southeast, and southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;Rising up behind the stall is a tall wooden post.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] e&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The stallkeeper" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Fruit Stall&#x000A;Bins heaped high with brightly colored fruit lend a pleasant fragrance to this end of the market (though by afternoon it will have become a cloying reek that attracts more flies than customers). They have apples and pears from the city orchards, and brambleberries from the northern counties. Oranges, limes, kello fruit - even a bushel of bananas from the Kozar Delta. Aisles between the stalls lead northwest, west, southwest, and south.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] steal banana&#x000A;Ah, this is something you know how to do, at least. You sidle up casually to the stall, wait until the stallkeeper seems preoccupied, then reach out and pluck the banana from the shelf.&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly the stallkeeper jabs his finger at you and screams, "Stop, thief!"&#x000A;&#x000A;One of the mercenaries happens to be wandering by at that moment. He hears the stallkeeper's shouts and comes running straight for you!&#x000A;&#x000A;Then there is a loud screech, and something brown and hairy scampers out from under the mercenary's feet. He stumbles, trips, and pitches headlong into the fruit stall. Fruit flies everywhere. The stallkeeper is wailing and berating the mercenary, who is covered with juice and slimy pulp.&#x000A;&#x000A;In the general chaos, you slip away easily, stuffing the banana into your satchel. Fortunately, no one managed to get a very good look at you, and the stallkeeper will be too busy cleaning up his wares to keep an eye out for you. You shouldn't have any trouble coming back here if you need to.&#x000A;&#x000A;Eastern Junction&#x000A;You're near the eastern edge of Grubber's Market. Commerce Street lies to the east. You can travel along the outer ring of stalls to the north or south, or head towards the market's central hub to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[15] unxyzzy&#x000A;A hollow voice whispers "oorg."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] s&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The stallkeeper" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Hat Stall&#x000A;Hats of all styles and sizes hang from scores of wooden pegs, a forest of varied headgear. They have big, flop-brimmed traveling hats; small, leather workman's caps; wide sappans of woven straw from the Kozar delta; fancy, feathered hats for courtly balls; and even a few ordinary bonnets. More stalls lie to the north, northwest, west, and southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[17] w&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Outside the Silk Tent&#x000A;Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or move on to one of the many other stalls to the east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;You see a tall wooden post rising up behind the tent.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[18] w&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The stallkeeper" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Exotic Gems Stall&#x000A;Dozens of jewels in exotic colors and cuts are spread out on display here, glittering in the dusty sunlight. Some of them are loose stones, others are set in finely wrought rings and necklaces. Most of them were probably smuggled in from over the western mountains, which is why they're cheap enough to be affordable to anyone in Grubber's Market. Still, they're far, far out of your price range. Other stalls lie to the north, northeast, east, and southeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly you hear a commotion from the back of the stall: the crash of a display case hitting the ground; shouts and curses from the stall keeper; and a horrific, gibbering shriek.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Come back here, you flea-bitten thief!" yells the stallkeeper, and for a panicked moment you think he means you. Then you see something small and gray dart up to the roof of the stall... it's just a forest monkey, probably someone's pet running loose. And it's clutching one of the stall keeper's necklaces in its tiny black fist.&#x000A;&#x000A;The monkey turns and screeches back at the stall keeper, dodges a clumsily thrown dirt clod, and scampers away.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] e&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Outside the Silk Tent&#x000A;Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or move on to one of the many other stalls to the east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the tent is a tall wooden post.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] n&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Teisha" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Inside the Silk Tent&#x000A;The walls of the tent provide a bit of quiet and privacy from the crowds outside (in addition to keeping dust off the merchandise). Beautiful silk garments hang on either side. Gowns, robes, capes, cloaks, and shawls, the fabric rippling with the slightest movement of air, shimmering with that soft, liquid glow that only silk has. The main market lies to the south. A narrow gap in the back leads behind the tent.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hello, Jack," says Teisha. "Change your mind about that cloak?" Then she gets a look at your face and frowns. "Something the matter, sweetie? You look spooked."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Teisha"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "There are big guys with swords chasing me."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "Actually, I'd like to look at that cloak again."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="3"&gt;3. "No, everything's fine."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[21] n&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Teisha holds the back flap back as you duck through. "Be careful now..." she says, "...Jacqueline."&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the Silk Tent&#x000A;This is a cramped little square formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post, which rises up a good twenty feet from here. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[22] u&#x000A;You're totally hidden back here, so there's no one to stop you from climbing. By the time you're high enough for people to see you, you're also high enough that no one will notice anyway; no one ever bothers to look up in Grubber's Market. After a minute or so of grunting and sweating, you reach the top.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The monkey" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Top of the Post&#x000A;Perched atop the high central post, you can look out over the whole market square. To the north, Lord's Road heads out of the city towards Lord's Keep. Commerce Street and the rest of the city beckon to the east. In every other direction the city is surrounded by rolling meadows and farmlands.&#x000A;&#x000A;Four anchor cables stretch away in four directions: northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;Balancing on one of the wires is that monkey.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[23] give banana to monkey&#x000A;(first taking the banana)&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;You hold out the banana and wiggle it enticingly. "Here, monkey. C'mon, little monkey," you whisper, trying to ignore how stupid it sounds.&#x000A;&#x000A;The monkey creeps closer, eyes locked on the yellow fruit. It's only about a foot away from your out-stretched hand now. Its little face contorts into bizarre expressions as it wrestles with the conflicting desires to grab the tasty treat, hold onto the shiny trinket, and stay out of your reach, all at the same time.&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly the monkey lunges. You make a grab with your free hand. The monkey grabs the banana just as your fingers hook around the necklace's chain. The monkey screams, jumps six feet straight up, lands on your head, and scampers off down the wire behind you. Your heart leaps into your throat as you lose your balance on top of the pole. You totter, pinwheel your arms... and stay on.&#x000A;&#x000A;You're breathing hard, but you're safe. And you have the necklace.&#x000A;&#x000A;Somewhere far below you, a stallkeeper is cursing and wiping smushed banana off his face.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[24] d&#x000A;You take a deep breath, lower yourself carefully until you're hugging the side of the pole, and let yourself slide down.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the Silk Tent&#x000A;This is a cramped little square formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post, which rises up a good twenty feet from here.

Gowns, robes, capes, cloaks, and shawls, the fabric rippling with the slightest movement of air, shimmering with that soft, liquid glow that only silk has. The main market lies to the south. A narrow gap in the back leads behind the tent.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[26] give necklace to teisha&#x000A;You hold out the necklace, dangling it by its chain. "Have a look at this, Teisha," you say. "You think this is worth one of your cloaks?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Teisha's eyebrow shoots up, but she manages to hide her excitement with the coolness of a professional haggler. "That's not bad," she mutters. "Most of Hathid's wares are just pretty glass, but this..." She gives you a look. "Now, tell me the truth, Jack, you didn't just steal this from somewhere, did you?"&#x000A;&#x000A;You shake your head proudly. It's not exactly a lie.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Well, not that it matters." The necklace disappears into one of Teisha's pockets. "Let's see..." she starts searching through the clothes, looking for something in your size. "This should fit. I think it suits you, too." She holds out a light green cloak. "What do you think?"&#x000A;&#x000A;It takes your breath away, but you try to hide your eagerness just as Teisha hid hers. "It's tricky," you say, nodding casually.&#x000A;&#x000A;Teisha laughs. "Then it's yours."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;Suddenly you hear someone shouting just outside: "Hey, any of you dims check inside this tent yet?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Teisha's face turns white. "Hurry, Jack!" she hisses, "Out the back way!"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[27] n&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Without pausing to think, you dive through the back flap.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the Silk Tent&#x000A;This is a cramped little square formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post, which rises up a good twenty feet from here. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can hear Teisha yelling shrilly at the mercenaries behind you - then her tirade is cut off abruptly amidst grunted curses. Someone is fumbling with the back flap of the tent!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[28] u&#x000A;With speed borne of panic, you scamper up the wooden post.&#x000A;&#x000A;Top of the Post&#x000A;Perched atop the high central post, you can look out over the whole market square. To the north, Lord's Road heads out of the city towards Lord's Keep. Commerce Street and the rest of the city beckon to the east. In every other direction the city is surrounded by rolling meadows and farmlands.&#x000A;&#x000A;Four anchor cables stretch away in four directions: northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;One of the mercenaries tries to climb after you, but can't get more than a few feet up before sliding back. Looks like you're safe for the time being - but they're already heatedly discussing how to get you down, and there are only so many ways you can go from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[29] slide down northeast cable with gray cloak&#x000A;You wrap one end of the old gray cloak around your hand, then squat down and sling the other end around the anchor cable. You give it a good, hard yank to test your grip. You take a deep breath. You try to convince your heartbeat to slow down, or at least continue its dreadful hammering in some part of your body other than your throat. You fail. Then, finally, you swing down under the wire and kick off into space.&#x000A;&#x000A;The wind is exhilarating as you zip down the line. The ground rushes up at you with terrifying speed. The old gray cloak whizzes hotly against the rough wire, and you vaguely smell smoke, but your impromptu harness holds. Shouts ring out and fingers point as the mercenaries spot you and race to where they think you will land. Suddenly your feet hit dirt. You let go of the old gray cloak and tumble to the hard ground, knocking over a couple of shoppers before you roll to a stop. The next moment you are back on your feet, bruised and breathless.&#x000A;&#x000A;Fruit Stall&#x000A;The fruit stall is still a complete mess, with most of the merchandise scattered all over the ground. The stallkeeper is practically tearing his beard out with frustration.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see your old gray cloak here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The stallkeeper" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;You hear shouting coming from all quarters of the market. If the mercenaries saw where you landed, they'll be after you in no time.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[30] get cloak&#x000A;(the old gray cloak)&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;The shouts are getting closer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[31] wear silk cloak&#x000A;You slip the silk cloak over your shoulders and pull the hood up. The fabric feels smooth and cool on your skin, but you don't have time to admire it now - you've got to run!&#x000A;&#x000A;You hear curses and yells of pain as the mercenaries shove their way through the crowds of shoppers. They're closing in!&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[32] s&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;You sprint through the crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Eastern Junction&#x000A;You're near the eastern edge of Grubber's Market. Commerce Street lies to the east. You can travel along the outer ring of stalls to the north or south, or head towards the market's central hub to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Someone yells, "There! I see him!"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[33] e&#x000A;You reach the edge of the market just ahead of your pursuers and see the mercenary captain standing there. He hasn't seen the commotion yet; he's still casually scanning faces.&#x000A;&#x000A;You skid to a halt. Everything depends on you looking like you're not in a hurry.&#x000A;&#x000A;You force yourself to walk slow. Underneath the hood, sweat is pouring down your cheeks, and you can barely control your breathing. The shouts behind you are getting nearer. The captain is not looking at you, he's looking at the mercenaries pounding up behind you. Does he understand what they're shouting? Just a few more steps...&#x000A;&#x000A;A bead of sweat rolls off the tip of your nose and drops to the ground, leaving a little dark spot in the dust. Did the captain notice?&#x000A;&#x000A;Five steps... four steps... three steps...&#x000A;&#x000A;You hear a confused babble of voices behind you as the captain orders his men to halt and explain what's going on.&#x000A;&#x000A;You slip through the crowds into Commerce Street...&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Please press SPACE to continue.</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Chapter 2 - Bobby&#x000A;You made it.&#x000A;&#x000A;You let out a long, shaky breath. You're safe now. Commerce Street is home to a slightly more upscale class of merchant, and business here is not quite as frantic as in Grubber's Market. Transactions tend to be calmer, more deliberate, and involve significantly more money. The Lord's Guard will be far less tolerant of a pack of armed bullies menacing the citizens of the upper class, so it's unlikely that the mercenaries will follow you here. And even if they did, there are too many streets and side alleys for them to block off your escape.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gratefully, you remove the cloak, which was beginning to stick to your skin with all the sweat. Now it's time to pause, catch your breath, and try to figure out why they were after you in the first place.&#x000A;&#x000A;Commerce Street&#x000A;Commerce Street runs east to west, between Grubber's Market and Lord's Market. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[34] test meeting&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[35] e&#x000A;&#x000A;East Commerce Street&#x000A;The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.&#x000A;&#x000A;Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[36] e&#x000A;Lords Market&#x000A;Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south. &#x000A;&#x000A;As you are standing there getting your bearings, the door to the moneylender's shop suddenly slams open. A tall, dark-cloaked figure storms out, shouting over his shoulder, "...regret refusing my business! I know import-OOF!" -and before you have a chance to react, he crashes into you. You both hit the cobbles in a tangle of limbs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Muttering apologies, you try to disentangle yourself, but the man is on his feet in an instant, dragging you up by your elbow. "Why you insolent little cutpurse-"&#x000A;&#x000A;A woman standing next to him places her hand on his shoulder. "Calm yourself, Fossville," she says. Only her chin is visible beneath the shadow of her hood, but the woman's voice is cool and commanding. "It's only a foolish street boy. You've already terrified him."&#x000A;&#x000A;The man - you realize now that he must be Baron Fossville, Lord of the city since the old Duke died, and one of the most powerful nobles in Toresal - eyes you suspiciously. Even flustered, his sharp features are intense, handsome, and dangerously intelligent. His lips twitch slightly beneath his trim moustache. Finally, he releases you.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Off with you then, urchin," he growls, flicking his fingers as though he had just touched something filthy. "Take your begging elsewhere, and learn to stay out from under the feet of your betters."&#x000A;&#x000A;Fossville strides off towards Commerce Street, followed closely by his hooded companion. As she brushes past you, you can hear her talking in a low voice, "...have the money you need, but we must be subtle about it. The Queen can not appear to play favorites..."&#x000A;&#x000A;And then they are gone.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[37] s&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Back Alley&#x000A;A little-known shortcut between Lord's Market and the less affluent neighborhoods of the city's south end. A narrow street to the southwest leads to Maiden House, or you can return to the market square to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the end of the alley, a group of young urchins - none older than their eighth year - are clustered around something. As you draw closer, you see Bobby crouched in the midst of them. He's holding his arm out, his fist loosely clenched in front of a dirty-cheeked child of six.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Go on," says Bobby. "Go on, take a look."&#x000A;&#x000A;The little boy, his eyes wide and solid, reaches out and pries Bobby's fingers open. His hand is empty. The little boy looks dismayed.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Ah, but what's this?" asks Bobby. And he reaches forward and draws a copper coin from behind the boy's grimy ear. A collective gasp, then squeals of delight from the rest of the children, and the little boy's eyes look ready to fall out of his head.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby presses the coin into the little boy's hand, then passes out more coins to the others. "Here," he says, "keep it safe in your pocket. Spend it on bread, not candy." The children take their prizes and scatter.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby stands and stretches, then sees you. The corner of his mouth goes up in that lop-sided grin you know so well. "'Lo, Jack,' he says. "What's happening?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Nothing much."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "I was chased by some mercenaries."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[38] 1&#x000A;"Oh, nothing much," you say. "Just, you know... doing stuff. Around the city. Staying tricky."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Huh," says Bobby, nodding vaguely.&#x000A;&#x000A;Goddesses, you think to yourself, I am such a dim!&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "What did you want to see me for?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "Can I ask you a question?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;Bobby smirks at you in that way he has, that makes you want to smile and blush and run and hide, all at the same time.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[39] 1&#x000A;"So, I heard you were looking for me," you say. "What'd you want to tell me?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby grins.&#x000A;&#x000A;He makes a show of looking carefully over one shoulder, then the other, then leans close to whisper. "I found this new place, right? It's a big secret, extra tricky. I was thinking of doing a bit of exploring there later tonight. You want to come with?" He smiles that knowing half-smile of his, the one that always means he's about to do something that will be very fun, or land you both in a pile of trouble, or - the usual case - both.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Where is this place?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "I'm in."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;Bobby rakes his fingers back through his tangled hair.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[40] 2&#x000A;Could you even consider saying no? "Okay, let's do it," you say, your heart thumping hard. "I'm in."&#x000A;&#x000A;"You're a good bloke, Jack," says Bobby. "Now, you don't want the Maidens worrying about you, so head on home for now. Once it gets dark, sneak back out and meet me in the Grubber's Market. Right? Good. See you later, Jack." He claps his hand on your shoulder, then turns and strides, all grace and overconfidence, out of the alley.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[41] sw&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Entrance to Maiden House&#x000A;The alley dead-ends in a small courtyard surrounded by old, run-down buildings.&#x000A;&#x000A;A battered wooden door provides entrance into the southern building. There's no sign, but you know it well nonetheless - this is the door to Maiden House, your "home".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[42] s&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Widow Theresa" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;You slip quietly through the front door, into the familiar smells of cooking grease and laundry soap; the familiar sight of shabby, warped floorboards lit by dim, flickering tallow lamps. It's nothing fancy, but it's home, and you're familiar enough with the plight of most of Toresal's orphans to know that you're lucky to have it.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The main hallway runs north-south through the center of Maiden House, with several doorways leading to rooms on either side. To the southeast and southwest are the laundry and privy, respectively; to the northeast lies the kitchen; and to the northwest is the dormitory where you and the other orphans sleep.&#x000A;&#x000A;The front door is open.&#x000A;&#x000A;Widow Theresa, who probably has been lurking here all day, just waiting for you to return, springs out from her corner and slams the front door shut. "The evening churchbells are ringing, Jacqueline," she tells you, her mouth set in a satisfied little line. "Well past the time when any respectable young lady should be out on the streets." She locks the door with a long brass key that she wears on a ribbon around her neck.&#x000A;&#x000A;Widow Theresa turns to you. "You're filthy," she says, "though no more than usual. I realize it's too much to ask you to actually do any of your chores, but you might at least like to wash yourself, if only in consideration for the next poor girl who has to wash your sheets."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Widow Theresa"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "And how are you this evening?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "You can't lock me in!"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="3"&gt;3. "Give me a break, I was chased by mercenaries this morning."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[43] sw&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Privy&#x000A;Not much more than a narrow closet, with a hole in the floor and a bench over it. At least it's more private than an alley.&#x000A;&#x000A;A narrow window over the bench provides some ventilation.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[44] climb through window&#x000A;You sneak a furtive glance back at the hallway, then step up onto the bench. It wobbles under your feet, and you grab the window sill to steady yourself.&#x000A;&#x000A;Then, holding your breath to keep from making a sound, you pull yourself up and through. The window is at ground level outside, and you wriggle out onto the slick cobblestones.&#x000A;&#x000A;You're free! Of course, the widows will find out you're gone soon enough - Maiden House is not a very big place, after all. But you've snuck out before, and they know you can take care of yourself. At worst, you'll pull extra laundry duty for a few days.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind Maiden House&#x000A;This tiny spur of an alleyway runs between the back of Maiden House and the high stone wall surrounding the park. You can make your way around to the Maiden House Entrance to the northeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[45] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Entrance to Maiden House&#x000A;The alley dead-ends in a small courtyard surrounded by old, run-down buildings.&#x000A;&#x000A;The door to Maiden House is closed.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[46] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Back Alley&#x000A;A little-known shortcut between Lord's Market and the less affluent neighborhoods of the city's south end. A narrow street to the southwest leads to Maiden House, or you can return to the market square to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[47] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Lords Market&#x000A;At night, lanterns hung from ornate posts light the empty square of Lord's Market. Their warm yellow glow seems to make the shadows in the alleys that much darker. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[48] w&#x000A;&#x000A;East Commerce Street&#x000A;The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.&#x000A;&#x000A;Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Commerce Street&#x000A;Commerce Street at night is eerily quiet and empty. Your footsteps seem to echo on the cobbles as you walk past the shuttered shopfronts. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[50] w&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Grubber's Market&#x000A;At night, the normally crowded marketplace is an empty maze of shadows, abandoned stalls and rolled-up canvas. The Lord's Road lies north, your little alley lies northwest, and Commerce Street lies back east.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is standing in the middle of Grubber's Market, under the shadow of the center post. &#x000A;&#x000A;When you get closer, he walks over and claps you on the shoulder. "Had a spot of trouble getting away from the Maidens, eh, Jack?" he whispers.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Not really."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "I had to sneak out."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[51] test adventure&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[52] n&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;You're too filled with nervous excitement to chit-chat; you want to get on with the adventure! With a grin, you walk right past Bobby without answering towards the gate out of town.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby cocks an eyebrow at you "Well, okay then," he mutters, and hurries to catch up.&#x000A;&#x000A;Lord's Road&#x000A;The wide and well-paved Lord's Road runs from Grubber's Market straight north to Lord's Keep, a mile or so from the city. To the east are rolling pastures; to the west, broken ground and scrub.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby jerks his thumb down the road, to the north. "This road leads straight to the front gate of Lord's Keep; we want to stay away from there. I know a better way," he says with a knowing smile, and strikes off towards the open field to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[53] e&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Pasture&#x000A;This wide, open field is used by the city for tourneys and other holiday events, or by cattle-sellers driving their livestock to market. Tonight it is empty except for the occasional cow pie. To the north you can see the dark, rough edge of a forest.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is here, waiting for you. &#x000A;&#x000A;You feel nervous and exposed out here in all this empty space; you're more used to the narrow alleys and enclosing walls of the city. The urge to hunch over and make yourself small is near-irresistible.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby, meanwhile, strides out into the middle of the moonlit field, standing straight and swinging his arms wide. "Fresh air, Jack!" he calls out, laughing. "Enjoy it! Take a deep breath!" He heads north, still laughing.&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[54] n&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Stream Crossing&#x000A;A small stream bubbles out of the woods and cuts through the pasture's north end. The edge of the forest lies to the north, just across the water. The city is far away to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is here, waiting for you. &#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby hops nimbly across, bouncing from rock to rock as though he were playing a game of Circles-and-Stones in the park. He doesn't get so much as the hem of his cloak damp. When he gets to the opposite bank, he turns and beckons you to follow before disappearing into the shadowy woods.&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[55] xyzzy&#x000A;A hollow voice whispers "groo."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[56] n&#x000A;The first couple of rocks are easy enough, but the third one wobbles when you put your weight on it. You end up pinwheeling your arms desperately, contorting yourself in every direction to avoid a tumble and a thorough soaking. Finally, with arms outstretched and lower lip clamped between your teeth, you pick your way across the remainder of the stream with all the grace of a drunkard on a greased tightrope.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the woods, Bobby is nearly doubled over with silent laughter. He claps you on the back. "You're a good sport, Jack," he says. "C'mon, we're nearly there."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Woods&#x000A;You are in the woodlands just southeast of Lord's Keep, following the game trails that wind their way through strands of pale birch and black spruce. There is just enough moonlight trickling through the upper branches to see your way by.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is here, waiting for you. &#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby motions you over to where he's standing, pushing back the underbrush. "Look here, Jack," he says. "These trails go every which way, and it's easy to get lost. But if you keep an eye out for this one sapling," -he points to a small tree split halfway down its length- "...you'll find the right trail." He heads off through the trees to the north.&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[57] unxyzzy&#x000A;A hollow voice whispers "oorg."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[58] n&#x000A;Clearing&#x000A;The woods open out here in a small, moonlit clearing. The ruins of an old pavilion lie here, pale pavestones poking up like bones from the grass.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is here, waiting for you. &#x000A;&#x000A;In the center of the clearing stands a crumbling fountain, topped by a cracked statue of the Goddess Brigid.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Here we are." Bobby jumps up into the bowl of the fountain, dried leaves crackling beneath his boots. Then he reaches around the statue of Brigid as though trying to embrace her. His hands fumble at something on the underside of the urn.&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly there is a deep, solid thunk and a scraping sound, and part of the base of the statue moves.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby hops down and pushes against the statue's base. A rectangle of stone about two feet square swings inward. The space behind it is utterly black, and a cold draft of damp-smelling air rises out of it.&#x000A;&#x000A;"It runs all the way to Lord's Keep," says Bobby as he brushes off his hands. "I don't think anyone knows about it. Maybe Lord Toresal did, but now that he's dead it's basically unknown. It's not been used for decades, I'd guess. Well anyway, until now."&#x000A;&#x000A;He holds out his hand. His lop-sided smile is absolutely charming. "After you, kind sir."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[59] d&#x000A;You grope your way down into the tunnel, carefully sliding your feet over steps you cannot see. Echoes fill the darkness: the scrape of your shoes on stone, the drip of water, your own loud breathing.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind you, you hear Bobby fumbling with something under his cloak; the click of stone on metal; and then a sickly orange glow spreads across the walls of the tunnel. Your own shadow wobbles hugely in front of you.&#x000A;&#x000A;You turn around and see Bobby holding a torch. He grins at you. "Tricky, isn't it?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Underneath The Fountain&#x000A;The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is here, waiting for you. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[60] n&#x000A;Ducking your head to avoid the low ceiling, you follow the tunnel for some distance.&#x000A;&#x000A;Tunnel End&#x000A;The tunnel ends here at a blank, stone wall.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby steps past you and brushes his fingertips across the stonework, holding the torch close. Eventually he finds a loose brick and pulls it free, revealing a rough, rectangular hole.&#x000A;&#x000A;You wonder how many times Bobby has been down here. He exudes such easy confidence as he reaches into the hole, as though he has done this many times before.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a click. Bobby looks over his shoulder at you and winks. And then the wall swings away, revealing shadowed spaces beyond.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[61] n&#x000A;Bobby jams his torch into a rusted bracket on the tunnel wall and steps through the secret door, gesturing you to follow. A prickle runs down your back as you step through after him. Are you really sneaking into the Lord's Keep? You're not even sure what the punishment for that is... something a lot worse than a few days in jail, certainly.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chapel&#x000A;The chapel of the Goddesses is a spacious, octagonal room, empty of furniture. The wood-paneled walls glow warmly, reflecting the light from dozens of devotional candles; the high ceiling disappears in the shadows overhead. A corridor leads southwest, and a secret passage in the south wall leads into subterranean gloom.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[62] sw&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The Lord's Guards" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Lower Bailey&#x000A;A thick wedge of shadow falls across the courtyard at the base of the Keep's outer wall, providing a relatively safe place to hide. The rest of the courtyard is flooded with moonlight, and bored-looking guards stroll back and forth over the gravel. You can enter another part of the castle to the northeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby moves up quietly behind you. He puts his mouth very, very close to your ear and whispers, "Up there," pointing to the steps leading up to the top of the wall.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[63] u&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;You wait, watching the nearest guard until he turns and begins walking away, then sprint lightly up the steps.&#x000A;&#x000A;Upper Bailey&#x000A;At the top of the wall you can lean out over the parapets and take in all the lands surrounding Toresal. It's a nice view, but torches set every few yards along the wall make this a dangerous spot to linger in. Stairs lead down into the courtyard below, and a dark archway opens to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[64] n&#x000A;Guardhouse&#x000A;A narrow antechamber, with an open archway to the south and an iron-reinforced door to the north. Arrow slits to either side lend the door an important and dangerous air.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby creeps forward and presses himself against the wall next to one of the arrow slits. He hunches closer, peering around the slit's edge. Then he looks up at you and smiles. He points at you, points at the arrow slit, then taps his ear. Listen, he's telling you.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[65] listen at slit&#x000A;You can hear several voices coming from the room on the other side of the arrow slit - guards relaxing on break, probably.&#x000A;&#x000A;"...and I says, I don't care who hired you, people are tryin' to do honest business here, and you're steppin' on toes. Take yer men and hit the road, or else you can continue searchin' for yer urchin boy in the city jail. And this tough fellow, him so hard with his sword and his scars and all, he just starts to cry, blubberin' like a frightened scullery maid!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Haw! Yer lyin', so you are!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Goddesses witness it, 'tis the truth! I could hardly credit it meself, and I weren't that impressed with the man to begin with. Go on, I says, and gave him a boot to the fundament to send him on his way."&#x000A;&#x000A;There is general laughter. You glance at Bobby, but he motions you to keep listening.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[66] listen to slit&#x000A;"You seen tomorrow's detail yet?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah, dress-up duty. Polishing helmets so we can look all pretty for the lords and ladies coming down to Baron Fussypants' ball."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Not just lords and ladies, I heard. Word has it the Queen herself is on the guest list, and she's expected to appear."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh, pull the other one."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Goddesses witness it. They say she's comin' down with her daughter in tow, that's why Fossville's hostin' the ball in the first place. He's tryin' to get in the Queen's good graces, so's he can marry the girl."&#x000A;&#x000A;"What, the Queen?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"No, you dim. He wants to marry the Princess. Our Lord Fussypants is trying to position himself for the throne."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Well, he's welcome to it, long as I'm paid at week's end. Of course, I'm not looking forward to spending a night standing at attention for a horde of fancy, feathered fops to goggle and gaggle at, but I guess it's better than latrine duty..."&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby pulls you away. He's grinning, his eyes wide and his eyebrows cocked. Isn't it great?&#x000A;&#x000A;But you're too nervous to care. There are who knows how many men of the Lord's Guard right on the other side of that door. Someone could walk out at any second. You grab Bobby's arm and give it a firm yank - It's time to go.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[67] s&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Upper Bailey&#x000A;At the top of the wall you can lean out over the parapets and take in all the lands surrounding Toresal. It's a nice view, but torches set every few yards along the wall make this a dangerous spot to linger in. Stairs lead down into the courtyard below, and a dark archway opens to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[68] d&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The Lord's Guards" /&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Lower Bailey&#x000A;A thick wedge of shadow falls across the courtyard at the base of the Keep's outer wall, providing a relatively safe place to hide. The rest of the courtyard is flooded with moonlight, and bored-looking guards stroll back and forth over the gravel. You can enter another part of the castle to the northeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[69] ne&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Chapel&#x000A;The chapel of the Goddesses is a spacious, octagonal room, empty of furniture. The wood-paneled walls glow warmly, reflecting the light from dozens of devotional candles; the high ceiling disappears in the shadows overhead. A corridor leads southwest, and a secret passage in the south wall leads into subterranean gloom.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[70] s&#x000A;Tunnel End&#x000A;The wall at the north end of the tunnel has swung open, revealing a secret entrance to the castle.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby reaches back and pulls the secret door shut, carefully easing it the last few inches so that it doesn't slam. He puts the loose brick back in its place, just as before, and tugs his torch free of the bracket where he'd left it.&#x000A;&#x000A;We're out, you realize with a sense of overwhelming relief. We made it. It's like we were never here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Some adventure, eh, Jack?" laughs Bobby. His voice is disturbingly loud after the long minutes of terrified silence in the keep. "Eavesdropping on the Lord's own guardsmen! That's a story that'll have the little ones wide-eyed at the Maiden House, eh?" He claps you on the back, and you manage a smile. It was fun, and you want Bobby to think you had fun, but it will be a while before you feel up to something that dangerous again.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[71] s&#x000A;Stealthily, you creep back up the long tunnel to the stone steps under the fountain. "I'll go up first," whispers Bobby, "to make sure the coast is clear." He dunks his torch in a puddle of mud and bounds lightly up the steps. For a moment you can see him silhouetted against the starlight; then he moves away from the opening and disappears from view.&#x000A;&#x000A;You wait for ten heartbeats. Behind you, you hear the distant plip of dripping moisture, far back in the dark tunnel. Above you, you can hear crickets chirping in the nearby forest.&#x000A;&#x000A;Ten more heartbeats. "Bobby?" you call out in a hoarse whisper. Maybe he can't hear you, but you're too nervous to raise your voice. "Bobby? Are you up there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;There is no answer.&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[72] u&#x000A;You crawl out of the hole in the base of the statue, into the dirt and leaves littering the bottom of the fountain. Apart from your scrabbling, it's quiet out here - very quiet.&#x000A;&#x000A;Even the crickets have stopped, you realize. Finally, you get to your feet and look around.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is lying face-down in the grass, just a few yards away. One of the mercenaries from Grubber's Market is kneeling with his knee in the small of Bobby's back, binding his wrists together with twine. Standing around the outside of the fountain are several more mercenaries, looking relaxed and smug. Some of them are chuckling to themselves.&#x000A;&#x000A;A gaunt man wearing red robes walks up to you. His mouth is half-hidden by long, drooping, black moustaches, but underneath them he is smiling like a snake. "Well now, young...sir? Or is it 'miss'? So much confusion, all to catch one little mouse. You led us a merry chase this morning, little mouse, but I think you will not scurry away from us again."&#x000A;&#x000A;Leaves crunch behind you. You jump for it, but too slow - rough hands haul you back, and a sack of coarse, black cloth is pulled over your head.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Good night, little mouse."&#x000A;&#x000A;Something hard and heavy strikes the back of your head, and the night turns black as pitch.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Please press SPACE to continue.</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Slowly the world comes back to you. You feel something cold and hard against your cheek; something gritty and scratchy under your hand. You hear footsteps on stone, muttering voices that fade in and out. Someone laughs, a raw, cruel sound. A loud squeak, and an echoing, metallic crash. The footsteps fade away.&#x000A;&#x000A;You open your eyes. It's still dark.&#x000A;&#x000A;No, it's just dim. Dim light trickles in from somewhere above you.&#x000A;&#x000A;You sit up, and a tender spot on the back of your head throbs. Red and purple splotches bloom in front of your eyes, then fade away. After a moment or two, your head clears, and you can see where you are.&#x000A;&#x000A;Holding Cell&#x000A;A dank, cramped, foul-smelling cell. A pair of ragged burlap blankets and a few lumps of filthy straw litter the floor. The door is to the north. &#x000A;&#x000A;A hulking shape squats in the corner, staring at you with bloodshot eyes. &#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The hulking shape" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;Chapter 3 - Jail&#x000A;&gt;[73] test jail&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[74] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[75] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The hulking shape" /&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;Suddenly you hear a voice whisper your name. "Jack..."&#x000A;&#x000A;At first you think it's the creepy guy in the corner, but he hasn't moved. You're still staring at him when the whisper comes again, louder this time: "Jack..." It's coming from somewhere outside the cell.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Bobby? Is that you?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[76] 1&#x000A;You rush up and press your face against the viewing window, but you can't see anything out there except an empty room. "Bobby?" you call, trying to keep the fear out of your voice. "Bobby, is that you? I'm locked in here, Bobby, help me!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The voice chuckles, then coughs weakly. "I'm in the cell next to yours, Jack. I'm locked in, too. Sorry."&#x000A;&#x000A;Your heart sinks a little at that, but at least being trapped in a cell with Bobby nearby is a little bit better than being trapped in a cell with no one around to help you at all... right?&#x000A;&#x000A;"Jack, listen," Bobby says. His voice is ragged and hoarse; you're worried that the mercenaries might have hurt him badly. "I'm going to get us out of this mess, don't worry. But in case I'm not able to meet up with you after, you need to listen carefully."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "What do you mean?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[77] 1&#x000A;"Not able to meet up with me?" you whisper, dismayed. "What do you mean? What-" but Bobby cuts you off.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Jack, listen to me. Go to Fossville's estate in the city. Use the rooftops. There's an alley behind the shops on Commerce Street where you can climb up."&#x000A;&#x000A;"You want me to break into Baron Fossville's house?" you whisper back, incredulously. "Bobby, I don't understand-"&#x000A;&#x000A;"He has secrets," Bobby goes on, "that you need to know. Secrets about your father."&#x000A;&#x000A;You pause, stunned.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Look for a letter-" says Bobby, but he is cut off by a door slamming open elsewhere in the room. Guards move past your cell door; one of them slams a wooden cudgel against the bars right in front of your face, and you stagger back.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Bobby, what's happening?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[78] 1&#x000A;"Bobby?" you cry, "Bobby? What's happening? What letter?"&#x000A;&#x000A;You hear a metallic rattling, the squeak of hinges. Then several meaty thuds, mixed with grunts and cries of pain. The guards reappear, this time dragging Bobby with them. He looks up as he passes the viewing window, and you get a brief glimpse of his face - bruised, bloody, but still smiling. You'd swear he was trying to wink at you, except that his eye is swollen shut.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Fossville, Jack!" he yells as they bundle him off. "The rooftops! Look for the letter!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Somewhere a door slams one final time... and then everything is silent.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The hulking shape" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[79] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly the shadowy man in the corner puts his huge, thick-fingered hands on his knees and pushes himself up. "Well," he grunts in a thick, rough voice, "now that the guards are busy takin care of him..." the man stretches, glances at you, and smiles. It is not a friendly smile.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hi, kid. Name's Jacobs."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Jacobs"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "My name's Jack."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "Stay away from me!"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="3"&gt;3. "Do you know any way to get out of here?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[80] 3&#x000A;"Do you, uh...," you clear your throat, "...do you know some way we could get out of this place?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Jacobs raises an eyebrow. "Well now, little runt. I suppose I do."&#x000A;&#x000A;The hulking man walks over to the cell door and squints at it for a while, standing with his hands on his hips. "My father'll have me out of here by tomorrow, of course," he mutters, "but I don't like to wait that long." He barely looks at you - in fact, you're not sure that he's talking to you at all. It's more like he's just muttering to himself.&#x000A;&#x000A;He bends over and digs something out of the side of his boot, then stands up and thrusts his hand through the viewing window. He curses and strains to push his arm through, but the bars are too narrowly spaced - he can't reach out past his elbow. "Damn," he mutters, "didn't expect this..."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[81] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Jacobs' face reddens with effort. "C'mon... c'mon..." he mutters.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Aaah! Goddesses curse it!" Jacobs jerks his hand back, rubbing his wrist.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Well, you gonna help me, runt, or not?" he asks, and holds out a short, stiff piece of wire, pinched between his thumb and forefinger.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Jacobs"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "What is that thing?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "I'd rather not."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="3"&gt;3. "Okay."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[82] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[83] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[84] 3&#x000A;"Um, okay," you say, and pluck the wire from his thick, calloused fingers.&#x000A;&#x000A;"That's the spirit, runt!" Jacobs says. Suddenly he comes over and puts his huge hands around your waist, hoisting you up as though you weighed no more than a sack of feathers. He feels strong enough to snap you in half.&#x000A;&#x000A;"You ever pick a lock before, runt?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Jacobs"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Yes."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "No."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[85] 1&#x000A;You manage a nod. It's sort of true... Bobby showed you a few tricks once, and you've practiced on an old padlock. But you've never tried to pick an actual working lock on an actual door before.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Good," Jacob says, pushing you up against the viewing window. "This one should be easy, long as you can reach it."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[86] unlock door with wire&#x000A;You slip your arm through the bars and reach down for the lock. It's a stretch - Jacobs has to lift you higher and press your shoulder painfully against the bars - but soon you feel the metal of the lockplate, and your fingers find the tiny, sharp-edged hole in the middle.&#x000A;&#x000A;You jam the end of the lockpick in and start wiggling it around. Almost immediately, you realize that this is not going to work. The angle is too awkward, and you can't see what you're doing, and you can't feel the tumblers the way Bobby showed you when you practiced on the front door of Maiden House...&#x000A;&#x000A;Then you feel the wire bump against something inside the lock. You manage to lever the end of the wire under something and push... you feel it start to give... you push a little harder, and it starts to pivot... you push harder, and it starts to slip off the end of your pick...&#x000A;&#x000A;And then there is a snap, and the pick jumps out of your fingers and tumbles to the ground outside the cell door.&#x000A;&#x000A;Jacobs puts you down. He puts his hand on the door... and pushes it open.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Well," he says, looking you over with a sly expression, "you are a valuable runt, after all."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[87] n&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Jailhouse&#x000A;The jailhouse is hardly more comfortable than the cells themselves, just a crude, small room of unfinished stone, with a wooden bench and table for the guards. Cells are south, west, and north. A foul smell comes from a tiny alcove to the southwest, and a passageway to the east leads out.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a lockpick here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Jacobs" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Jacobs arrives from the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;Jacobs turns to you. "I heard what your friend in the other cell said, before they dragged him out," he says. "Sounds like Fossville's taken quite an interest in you."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Jacobs"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Yes, he has."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "I don't know what you're talking about."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[88] get wire&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[89] unlock north door with wire&#x000A;"Fine, then," Jacobs snarls, "good luck getting past the guards, runt." He turns on his heel and stalks out, leaving you alone with the other prisoners.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;Picking a lock is much easier when you're standing on the ground and can see what you're doing. Twenty seconds, and you have the cell door open.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh, thank you, miss, thank you kindly. Goddesses" blessings upon you. Allow me to make introductions," the man wheezes. "I am called Olmer, and this is my associate, Darrens." The skinny man standing behind him smiles and nods enthusiastically.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Now," says Olmer, "if you will follow us, we will make our escape."&#x000A;&#x000A;Olmer and Darrens go southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[90] sw&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Darrens" /&gt;&lt;Character Name="Olmer" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Drain Room&#x000A;This tiny alcove reeks worse than the privy back at Maiden House, and that's saying something. The main room is back to the northeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;Set into the stone floor is a metal grate.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see Darrens and Olmer here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The guards use this place to relieve themselves," Olmer explains, "and sometimes for beatin' prisoners when they don't feel like moppin' the cells after. My back's not much for physical labor, but a spry one like yourself should have little trouble." He motions for you to lift up the grate.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[91] lift grate&#x000A;It's a strain, but you're just barely able to lift the heavy grate and drop it to the side with a dull clang. Olmer smiles and gestures towards the foul-smelling hole. "After you," he wheezes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[92] test sewers&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[93] xyzzy&#x000A;A hollow voice whispers "groo."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[94] down&#x000A;Well, it can't be that much worse than rotting in prison, you think. You sit down and dangle your feet over the edge of the hole. You can hear the sound of running water, and smell the sharp stink of sewage. You offer a quick prayer to Brigid - Please give me a chance to clean up before seeing Bobby again - take a deep breath, and drop down into darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Sewer&#x000A;The tunnels down here are made of ancient, unmortared brick, slimy with centuries of filth and mold. Dim light trickles down through narrow vents in the ceiling. Side tunnels split off in numerous directions, twisting away into darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Painted on the walls are a number of odd symbols.&#x000A;&#x000A;Olmer drops down into the muck next to you, followed by Darrens. "Now then, miss, cast your eye at these glyphs here," whispers Olmer. His voice echoes off into the blackness as he brushes the rough stone with his fingertips. "These are marked down by such poor blokes as have to take refuge down here on a more regular basis. They tells you where the tunnels lead, if you but know their language." Darrens nods in solemn agreement.&#x000A;&#x000A;"To get back to your neighborhood, you'll want to follow the red, see?" Olmer points off down the south tunnel. "Darrens and I, we must be off elsewhere, so we'll take our leave of you now. But follow the red and you can't go wrong."&#x000A;&#x000A;"It was very kind of you to set us free, young lady." He shakes your hand. (His hands are slimy with filth, but then so are yours.) "We've only our meagre gratitude with which to repay you, but we won't forget your generosity." Darrens nods vigorously and shakes as well.&#x000A;&#x000A;And then the two of them slosh off, leaving you alone.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;Chapter 4 - Sewer&#x000A;&gt;[95] s&#x000A;Sewer&#x000A;The tunnels down here are made of ancient, unmortared brick, slimy with centuries of filth and mold. Dim light trickles down through narrow vents in the ceiling. Side tunnels split off in numerous directions, twisting away into darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Painted on the walls are a number of odd symbols.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[96] x symbols&#x000A;The symbols are a number of crude shapes, no bigger than your hand. Each one is painted on the wall next to one of the side tunnels, as if to mark the way. You can make out a blue circle next to the north tunnel, a green triangle next to the east tunnel, a red crescent next to the south tunnel and a yellow square next to the west tunnel.  &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[97] s&#x000A;Access Tunnel&#x000A;The tunnels down here are made of ancient, unmortared brick, slimy with centuries of filth and mold. Dim light trickles down through narrow vents in the ceiling. Side tunnels split off in numerous directions, twisting away into darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;A ladder is bolted to the wall here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[98] x symbols&#x000A;You can't see any such thing.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[99] e&#x000A;Suddenly you find yourself in a tunnel where there are no symbols painted anywhere. You try to retrace your steps, but you must have taken a wrong turn somewhere, because now you can't find any symbols anywhere. All of the tunnels look alike; you are completely turned around and don't even know which direction you are stumbling in.&#x000A;&#x000A;The next tunnel you take leads you to an area with no vents - it is pitch black. You slip as you turn around and fall into the water. Something slick and wriggly brushes past your face, and you thrash to your feet.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can't see any light, anywhere. You don't know what direction you just came from. Cold, smelly water numbs your feet. Despair and paralyzing panic close in on you as you realize that you have no means of finding your way through this labyrinth.&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stuck down here, blind in the stinking blackness, forever.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You have died ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt; [100] x symbols&#x000A;Please give one of the answers above.&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt; [101] w&#x000A;Please give one of the answers above.&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt; [102] u&#x000A;Please give one of the answers above.&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt; [103] unxyzzy&#x000A;Please give one of the answers above.&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt; [104] test rooftops&#x000A;Please give one of the answers above.&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt; [105] test blackgate&#x000A;Please give one of the answers above.&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt; [106] test hanging&#x000A;Please give one of the answers above.&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt; [107] test maidens&#x000A;Please give one of the answers above.&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt; [108] test walk2&#x000A;Please give one of the answers above.&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt; [109] test walk3&#x000A;Please give one of the answers above.&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

You can issue these commands:&#x000A; "scripts off" and "scripts on" to pause and resume cut-scenes.&#x000A; "scripts forward" to allow a single scripted event to occur.&#x000A; "scripts" by itself shows a summary of scheduled events.&#x000A; "scripts list" gives a full list, (may not be useful except to programmers.) ]&#x000A;&#x000A;Mid-morning always sees the Grubber's Market at its most crowded. Servants from the aristocratic districts and villagers from outside Toresal crush themselves into the maze of stalls and stretched canvas, hoping to beat the noontime heat and get the farmers' produce while it's still fresh. The press of bodies, the din of haggling and bargains struck - it all makes getting around unnoticed easier, although not necessarily more pleasant. No fewer than half a dozen stall-gazing bumpkins have trod on your feet already this morning. You've kept your mouth shut, though. People remember an urchin who gives lip.&#x000A;&#x000A;"See anything you like?" asks the silk seller, with a teasing smile. You smile back. You couldn't afford the cheapest of her cloaks if you nicked ten purses in a morning, as Teisha well knows.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh, these are much too plain," you scoff, even as you gaze wistfully at the bright colors, the beautiful embroidery. Time for a bit of breakfast, you decide, and anyway if you linger too long, people will wonder what a boy is doing shopping for women's cloaks. "Perhaps I'll come back this afternoon, when you've put out your better wares."&#x000A;&#x000A;Teisha laughs. "Don't be a stranger, Jack."&#x000A;&#x000A;You make your way through the market, nicking an apple from the fruit stall while its owner argues with a fat Easterner over local politics. Everyone seems to be talking politics these days, you've noticed. Everywhere people are heatedly discussing Baron Fossville's tax policies or something called the "Ascension" - whatever that is. Boring stuff, really. Finally you reach a quiet alley where you can catch a breath from the crowds and enjoy your apple in peace.&#x000A;&#x000A;You settle yourself on a crate and take a bite of your apple. Suddenly, from the alley's entrance, you hear voices.&#x000A;Chapter 1 - Grubber's Market&#x000A;Jack Toresal and The Secret Letter&#x000A;Jack Toresal and The Secret Letter by Textfyre, Inc&#x000A;Copyright &#x00A9; 2008 by Textfyre, Inc&#x000A;Designed by David Cornelson and Michael Gentry&#x000A;Written by Michael Gentry&#x000A;Programmed by Graeme Jefferis&#x000A;Testing by Jacqueline A. Lott&#x000A;All rights reserved&#x000A;&#x000A;Alley&#x000A;This narrow alley is tucked away between a storehouse on one side and the canvas wall of a stallkeeper's tent on the other. It serves primarily as somewhere out-of-the-way for stallkeepers to sweep their garbage, so it's not exactly the most pleasant-smelling place in all of Miradania, but at least no one is likely to bother you here. You can leave to the southeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;Several crates are stacked up against the back wall of the alley.&#x000A;&#x000A;A group of people have gathered just outside the alley. You can't quite hear what they're saying from here, but there is a grim, ugly tone to them that speaks of dangerous doings.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

From here you have a good view of the market's northwest junction and Lord's Road leading out of town to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;A group of tough-looking mercenaries has gathered at the Northwest Junction. One of them is barking orders at the others in an angry voice.&#x000A;&#x000A;"...we know he skulks Grubber's most mornings, so spread out quick, cover all streets from the square," growls one of them, evidently the group's leader.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[4] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The leader spits on the dusty ground. "Keep your eyes open and don't take guff. But for the love of Brigid, keep your tempers and your swords covered unless you really need 'em. Ain't bein' paid to toss the locals."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[5] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;"And keep sharp!" the leader snaps. "Remember this is a kid we're lookin' for. Kids move fast, stay out of sight, slip through crowds easy. I find out later he got away under your nose, I'll have it off!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly, that bit of apple you swallowed a minute ago turns into a cold, hard chunk in your belly.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[6] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Now, everyone memorize the description." The leader pulls a dirty, folded bit of parchment from his belt and squints at it. "Shoulder-length brown hair," he reads, haltingly. "Green eyes. Slight of build. Ten, maybe twelve spans high." He holds his hand out flat, at what happens to be exactly your height. "Usually wears a hat and a gray cloak."&#x000A;&#x000A;He refolds the parchment and jams it back into his belt. "You dims got all that?"&#x000A;&#x000A;The others nod.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Okay, go!" barks the leader, and the mercenaries set out in several directions, moving at a brisk walk. Two men go to the north gates and start shoving them closed; the others enter the crowded market and start shoving their way through the suddenly flabbergasted crowds.&#x000A;&#x000A;Your heart sinks. This is definitely not good.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] d&#x000A;As you climb back down the crates, one of them wobbles and your foot slips. You tumble loudly to the cobblestones. "Stupid! Clumsy!" you mutter, scrambling to your feet.&#x000A;&#x000A;From the street, you hear, "What was that? Check the alley!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Two mercenaries rush in and spot you immediately. They approach warily, their arms spread wide.&#x000A;&#x000A;You're in trouble now...&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] se&#x000A;You dash away into the crowd, weaving between customers and pushing your way through the thickest knots of people. The mercenaries pound after you, yelling and shoving people out of their way, but they're too big and too slow, and you quickly manage to lose them.&#x000A;&#x000A;Grubber's Market, Northwest Junction&#x000A;This is the northwest corner of Grubber's Market. You can skirt around the edge of the market to the northeast or south, or head into the thick of it to the east or southeast. A wide, paved road leads north. You can also duck back into the alley to the northwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;The north gates leading to Lord's Road are closed.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] test market&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] xyzzy&#x000A;A hollow voice whispers "groo."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] e&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The stallkeeper" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Candlemaker's Stall&#x000A;The heat and fumes from the candlemaker's tallow pots make this stall an unpleasant place to loiter. Still, people need candles, and customers seem to be buying them as fast as the stall keeper can dip them. Most of the candles are tallow, fast-burning and cheap, but there are also a number of premade wax candles in different colors. Other stalls are to the north, east, west, southeast, and southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;Rising up behind the stall is a tall wooden post.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] e&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The stallkeeper" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Fruit Stall&#x000A;Bins heaped high with brightly colored fruit lend a pleasant fragrance to this end of the market (though by afternoon it will have become a cloying reek that attracts more flies than customers). They have apples and pears from the city orchards, and brambleberries from the northern counties. Oranges, limes, kello fruit - even a bushel of bananas from the Kozar Delta. Aisles between the stalls lead northwest, west, southwest, and south.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] steal banana&#x000A;Ah, this is something you know how to do, at least. You sidle up casually to the stall, wait until the stallkeeper seems preoccupied, then reach out and pluck the banana from the shelf.&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly the stallkeeper jabs his finger at you and screams, "Stop, thief!"&#x000A;&#x000A;One of the mercenaries happens to be wandering by at that moment. He hears the stallkeeper's shouts and comes running straight for you!&#x000A;&#x000A;Then there is a loud screech, and something brown and hairy scampers out from under the mercenary's feet. He stumbles, trips, and pitches headlong into the fruit stall. Fruit flies everywhere. The stallkeeper is wailing and berating the mercenary, who is covered with juice and slimy pulp.&#x000A;&#x000A;In the general chaos, you slip away easily, stuffing the banana into your satchel. Fortunately, no one managed to get a very good look at you, and the stallkeeper will be too busy cleaning up his wares to keep an eye out for you. You shouldn't have any trouble coming back here if you need to.&#x000A;&#x000A;Eastern Junction&#x000A;You're near the eastern edge of Grubber's Market. Commerce Street lies to the east. You can travel along the outer ring of stalls to the north or south, or head towards the market's central hub to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[15] unxyzzy&#x000A;A hollow voice whispers "oorg."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] s&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The stallkeeper" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Hat Stall&#x000A;Hats of all styles and sizes hang from scores of wooden pegs, a forest of varied headgear. They have big, flop-brimmed traveling hats; small, leather workman's caps; wide sappans of woven straw from the Kozar delta; fancy, feathered hats for courtly balls; and even a few ordinary bonnets. More stalls lie to the north, northwest, west, and southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[17] w&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Outside the Silk Tent&#x000A;Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or move on to one of the many other stalls to the east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;You see a tall wooden post rising up behind the tent.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[18] w&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The stallkeeper" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Exotic Gems Stall&#x000A;Dozens of jewels in exotic colors and cuts are spread out on display here, glittering in the dusty sunlight. Some of them are loose stones, others are set in finely wrought rings and necklaces. Most of them were probably smuggled in from over the western mountains, which is why they're cheap enough to be affordable to anyone in Grubber's Market. Still, they're far, far out of your price range. Other stalls lie to the north, northeast, east, and southeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly you hear a commotion from the back of the stall: the crash of a display case hitting the ground; shouts and curses from the stall keeper; and a horrific, gibbering shriek.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Come back here, you flea-bitten thief!" yells the stallkeeper, and for a panicked moment you think he means you. Then you see something small and gray dart up to the roof of the stall... it's just a forest monkey, probably someone's pet running loose. And it's clutching one of the stall keeper's necklaces in its tiny black fist.&#x000A;&#x000A;The monkey turns and screeches back at the stall keeper, dodges a clumsily thrown dirt clod, and scampers away.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] e&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Outside the Silk Tent&#x000A;Teisha has done well enough for herself that her "stall" is actually a full-on tent. You can enter the tent to the north, or move on to one of the many other stalls to the east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;Rising up behind the tent is a tall wooden post.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] n&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Teisha" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Inside the Silk Tent&#x000A;The walls of the tent provide a bit of quiet and privacy from the crowds outside (in addition to keeping dust off the merchandise). Beautiful silk garments hang on either side. Gowns, robes, capes, cloaks, and shawls, the fabric rippling with the slightest movement of air, shimmering with that soft, liquid glow that only silk has. The main market lies to the south. A narrow gap in the back leads behind the tent.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hello, Jack," says Teisha. "Change your mind about that cloak?" Then she gets a look at your face and frowns. "Something the matter, sweetie? You look spooked."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Teisha"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "There are big guys with swords chasing me."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "Actually, I'd like to look at that cloak again."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="3"&gt;3.

"Be careful now..." she says, "...Jacqueline."&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the Silk Tent&#x000A;This is a cramped little square formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post, which rises up a good twenty feet from here. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[22] u&#x000A;You're totally hidden back here, so there's no one to stop you from climbing. By the time you're high enough for people to see you, you're also high enough that no one will notice anyway; no one ever bothers to look up in Grubber's Market. After a minute or so of grunting and sweating, you reach the top.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The monkey" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Top of the Post&#x000A;Perched atop the high central post, you can look out over the whole market square. To the north, Lord's Road heads out of the city towards Lord's Keep. Commerce Street and the rest of the city beckon to the east. In every other direction the city is surrounded by rolling meadows and farmlands.&#x000A;&#x000A;Four anchor cables stretch away in four directions: northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;Balancing on one of the wires is that monkey.&#x000A;&#x000A;The monkey turns the necklace over and over in its tiny hands, staring intently into the gem's blue depths.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[23] give banana to monkey&#x000A;(first taking the banana)&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;You hold out the banana and wiggle it enticingly. "Here, monkey. C'mon, little monkey," you whisper, trying to ignore how stupid it sounds.&#x000A;&#x000A;The monkey creeps closer, eyes locked on the yellow fruit. It's only about a foot away from your out-stretched hand now. Its little face contorts into bizarre expressions as it wrestles with the conflicting desires to grab the tasty treat, hold onto the shiny trinket, and stay out of your reach, all at the same time.&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly the monkey lunges. You make a grab with your free hand. The monkey grabs the banana just as your fingers hook around the necklace's chain. The monkey screams, jumps six feet straight up, lands on your head, and scampers off down the wire behind you. Your heart leaps into your throat as you lose your balance on top of the pole. You totter, pinwheel your arms... and stay on.&#x000A;&#x000A;You're breathing hard, but you're safe. And you have the necklace.&#x000A;&#x000A;Somewhere far below you, a stallkeeper is cursing and wiping smushed banana off his face.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[24] d&#x000A;You take a deep breath, lower yourself carefully until you're hugging the side of the pole, and let yourself slide down.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the Silk Tent&#x000A;This is a cramped little square formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post, which rises up a good twenty feet from here.

"You think this is worth one of your cloaks?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Teisha's eyebrow shoots up, but she manages to hide her excitement with the coolness of a professional haggler. "That's not bad," she mutters. "Most of Hathid's wares are just pretty glass, but this..." She gives you a look. "Now, tell me the truth, Jack, you didn't just steal this from somewhere, did you?"&#x000A;&#x000A;You shake your head proudly. It's not exactly a lie.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Well, not that it matters." The necklace disappears into one of Teisha's pockets. "Let's see..." she starts searching through the clothes, looking for something in your size. "This should fit. I think it suits you, too." She holds out a light green cloak. "What do you think?"&#x000A;&#x000A;It takes your breath away, but you try to hide your eagerness just as Teisha hid hers. "It's tricky," you say, nodding casually.&#x000A;&#x000A;Teisha laughs. "Then it's yours."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;Suddenly you hear someone shouting just outside: "Hey, any of you dims check inside this tent yet?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Teisha's face turns white. "Hurry, Jack!" she hisses, "Out the back way!"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[27] n&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Without pausing to think, you dive through the back flap.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind the Silk Tent&#x000A;This is a cramped little square formed by the backs of three stalls and Teisha's tent. It's barely big enough to stretch your arms out in. Right in the middle is the base of the huge central support post, which rises up a good twenty feet from here. You can duck back into Teisha's tent to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can hear Teisha yelling shrilly at the mercenaries behind you - then her tirade is cut off abruptly amidst grunted curses. Someone is fumbling with the back flap of the tent!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[28] u&#x000A;With speed borne of panic, you scamper up the wooden post.&#x000A;&#x000A;Top of the Post&#x000A;Perched atop the high central post, you can look out over the whole market square. To the north, Lord's Road heads out of the city towards Lord's Keep. Commerce Street and the rest of the city beckon to the east. In every other direction the city is surrounded by rolling meadows and farmlands.&#x000A;&#x000A;Four anchor cables stretch away in four directions: northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;One of the mercenaries tries to climb after you, but can't get more than a few feet up before sliding back. Looks like you're safe for the time being - but they're already heatedly discussing how to get you down, and there are only so many ways you can go from here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[29] slide down northeast cable with gray cloak&#x000A;You wrap one end of the old gray cloak around your hand, then squat down and sling the other end around the anchor cable. You give it a good, hard yank to test your grip. You take a deep breath. You try to convince your heartbeat to slow down, or at least continue its dreadful hammering in some part of your body other than your throat. You fail. Then, finally, you swing down under the wire and kick off into space.&#x000A;&#x000A;The wind is exhilarating as you zip down the line. The ground rushes up at you with terrifying speed. The old gray cloak whizzes hotly against the rough wire, and you vaguely smell smoke, but your impromptu harness holds. Shouts ring out and fingers point as the mercenaries spot you and race to where they think you will land. Suddenly your feet hit dirt. You let go of the old gray cloak and tumble to the hard ground, knocking over a couple of shoppers before you roll to a stop. The next moment you are back on your feet, bruised and breathless.&#x000A;&#x000A;Fruit Stall&#x000A;The fruit stall is still a complete mess, with most of the merchandise scattered all over the ground. The stallkeeper is practically tearing his beard out with frustration.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see your old gray cloak here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The stallkeeper" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;You hear shouting coming from all quarters of the market. If the mercenaries saw where you landed, they'll be after you in no time.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[30] get cloak&#x000A;(the old gray cloak)&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;A gangly farmer argues loudly with a nearby stallkeeper.&#x000A;&#x000A;The shouts are getting closer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[31] wear silk cloak&#x000A;You slip the silk cloak over your shoulders and pull the hood up. The fabric feels smooth and cool on your skin, but you don't have time to admire it now - you've got to run!&#x000A;&#x000A;You hear curses and yells of pain as the mercenaries shove their way through the crowds of shoppers. They're closing in!&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[32] s&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;You dive through the crowd.&#x000A;&#x000A;Eastern Junction&#x000A;You're near the eastern edge of Grubber's Market. Commerce Street lies to the east. You can travel along the outer ring of stalls to the north or south, or head towards the market's central hub to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Someone yells, "There! I see him!"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[33] e&#x000A;You reach the edge of the market just ahead of your pursuers and see the mercenary captain standing there. He hasn't seen the commotion yet; he's still casually scanning faces.&#x000A;&#x000A;You skid to a halt. Everything depends on you looking like you're not in a hurry.&#x000A;&#x000A;You force yourself to walk slow. Underneath the hood, sweat is pouring down your cheeks, and you can barely control your breathing. The shouts behind you are getting nearer. The captain is not looking at you, he's looking at the mercenaries pounding up behind you. Does he understand what they're shouting? Just a few more steps...&#x000A;&#x000A;A bead of sweat rolls off the tip of your nose and drops to the ground, leaving a little dark spot in the dust. Did the captain notice?&#x000A;&#x000A;Five steps... four steps... three steps...&#x000A;&#x000A;You hear a confused babble of voices behind you as the captain orders his men to halt and explain what's going on.&#x000A;&#x000A;You slip through the crowds into Commerce Street...&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Please press SPACE to continue.</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Chapter 2 - Bobby&#x000A;You made it.&#x000A;&#x000A;You let out a long, shaky breath. You're safe now. Commerce Street is home to a slightly more upscale class of merchant, and business here is not quite as frantic as in Grubber's Market. Transactions tend to be calmer, more deliberate, and involve significantly more money. The Lord's Guard will be far less tolerant of a pack of armed bullies menacing the citizens of the upper class, so it's unlikely that the mercenaries will follow you here. And even if they did, there are too many streets and side alleys for them to block off your escape.&#x000A;&#x000A;Gratefully, you remove the cloak, which was beginning to stick to your skin with all the sweat. Now it's time to pause, catch your breath, and try to figure out why they were after you in the first place.&#x000A;&#x000A;Commerce Street&#x000A;Commerce Street runs east to west, between Grubber's Market and Lord's Market. Raised sidewalks allow pedestrians to avoid the mud, horse dung, and occasional teamster's cart rumbling by. The shops here are actual buildings, spaced evenly along the avenue. Storefronts for a bakery, a butcher's shop, and an armory line the north side of the street from west to east. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[34] test meeting&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[35] e&#x000A;&#x000A;East Commerce Street&#x000A;The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.&#x000A;&#x000A;Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[36] e&#x000A;Lords Market&#x000A;Lord's Market is the high-class mirror to Grubber's Market: a wide, cobbled square, uncrowded and clean, shaded by tall buildings on either side. Here Toresal's upper crust can hunt for bargains inaccessible to the ordinary rabble. Antiques, custom jewelry, and similarly high-priced goods are available behind the tasteful shopfronts. A fine clothier's, a jewelry store, and a moneylender's shop lie northeast, east, and southeast, respectively; you can return to Commerce Street to the west; and an alley leads south. &#x000A;&#x000A;As you are standing there getting your bearings, the door to the moneylender's shop suddenly slams open. A tall, dark-cloaked figure storms out, shouting over his shoulder, "...regret refusing my business! I know import-OOF!" -and before you have a chance to react, he crashes into you. You both hit the cobbles in a tangle of limbs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Muttering apologies, you try to disentangle yourself, but the man is on his feet in an instant, dragging you up by your elbow. "Why you insolent little cutpurse-"&#x000A;&#x000A;A woman standing next to him places her hand on his shoulder. "Calm yourself, Fossville," she says. Only her chin is visible beneath the shadow of her hood, but the woman's voice is cool and commanding. "It's only a foolish street boy. You've already terrified him."&#x000A;&#x000A;The man - you realize now that he must be Baron Fossville, Lord of the city since the old Duke died, and one of the most powerful nobles in Toresal - eyes you suspiciously. Even flustered, his sharp features are intense, handsome, and dangerously intelligent. His lips twitch slightly beneath his trim moustache. Finally, he releases you.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Off with you then, urchin," he growls, flicking his fingers as though he had just touched something filthy. "Take your begging elsewhere, and learn to stay out from under the feet of your betters."&#x000A;&#x000A;Fossville strides off towards Commerce Street, followed closely by his hooded companion. As she brushes past you, you can hear her talking in a low voice, "...have the money you need, but we must be subtle about it. The Queen can not appear to play favorites..."&#x000A;&#x000A;And then they are gone.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[37] s&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Back Alley&#x000A;A little-known shortcut between Lord's Market and the less affluent neighborhoods of the city's south end. A narrow street to the southwest leads to Maiden House, or you can return to the market square to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the end of the alley, a group of young urchins - none older than their eighth year - are clustered around something. As you draw closer, you see Bobby crouched in the midst of them. He's holding his arm out, his fist loosely clenched in front of a dirty-cheeked child of six.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Go on," says Bobby. "Go on, take a look."&#x000A;&#x000A;The little boy, his eyes wide and solid, reaches out and pries Bobby's fingers open. His hand is empty. The little boy looks dismayed.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Ah, but what's this?" asks Bobby. And he reaches forward and draws a copper coin from behind the boy's grimy ear. A collective gasp, then squeals of delight from the rest of the children, and the little boy's eyes look ready to fall out of his head.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby presses the coin into the little boy's hand, then passes out more coins to the others. "Here," he says, "keep it safe in your pocket. Spend it on bread, not candy." The children take their prizes and scatter.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby stands and stretches, then sees you. The corner of his mouth goes up in that lop-sided grin you know so well. "'Lo, Jack,' he says. "What's happening?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Nothing much."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "I was chased by some mercenaries."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[38] 1&#x000A;"Oh, nothing much," you say. "Just, you know... doing stuff. Around the city. Staying tricky."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Huh," says Bobby, nodding vaguely.&#x000A;&#x000A;Goddesses, you think to yourself, I am such a dim!&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "What did you want to see me for?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "Can I ask you a question?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;Bobby whistles a few notes of some popular mummer's tune.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[39] 1&#x000A;"So, I heard you were looking for me," you say. "What'd you want to tell me?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby grins.&#x000A;&#x000A;He makes a show of looking carefully over one shoulder, then the other, then leans close to whisper. "I found this new place, right? It's a big secret, extra tricky. I was thinking of doing a bit of exploring there later tonight. You want to come with?" He smiles that knowing half-smile of his, the one that always means he's about to do something that will be very fun, or land you both in a pile of trouble, or - the usual case - both.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Where is this place?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "I'm in."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;You realize you're staring, and quickly find something else to look at. Goddesses, but he's handsome.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[40] 2&#x000A;Could you even consider saying no? "Okay, let's do it," you say, your heart thumping hard. "I'm in."&#x000A;&#x000A;"You're a good bloke, Jack," says Bobby. "Now, you don't want the Maidens worrying about you, so head on home for now. Once it gets dark, sneak back out and meet me in the Grubber's Market. Right? Good. See you later, Jack." He claps his hand on your shoulder, then turns and strides, all grace and overconfidence, out of the alley.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[41] sw&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Entrance to Maiden House&#x000A;The alley dead-ends in a small courtyard surrounded by old, run-down buildings.&#x000A;&#x000A;A battered wooden door provides entrance into the southern building. There's no sign, but you know it well nonetheless - this is the door to Maiden House, your "home".&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[42] s&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Widow Theresa" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;You slip quietly through the front door, into the familiar smells of cooking grease and laundry soap; the familiar sight of shabby, warped floorboards lit by dim, flickering tallow lamps. It's nothing fancy, but it's home, and you're familiar enough with the plight of most of Toresal's orphans to know that you're lucky to have it.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hallway&#x000A;The main hallway runs north-south through the center of Maiden House, with several doorways leading to rooms on either side. To the southeast and southwest are the laundry and privy, respectively; to the northeast lies the kitchen; and to the northwest is the dormitory where you and the other orphans sleep.&#x000A;&#x000A;The front door is open.&#x000A;&#x000A;Widow Theresa, who probably has been lurking here all day, just waiting for you to return, springs out from her corner and slams the front door shut. "The evening churchbells are ringing, Jacqueline," she tells you, her mouth set in a satisfied little line. "Well past the time when any respectable young lady should be out on the streets." She locks the door with a long brass key that she wears on a ribbon around her neck.&#x000A;&#x000A;Widow Theresa turns to you. "You're filthy," she says, "though no more than usual. I realize it's too much to ask you to actually do any of your chores, but you might at least like to wash yourself, if only in consideration for the next poor girl who has to wash your sheets."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Widow Theresa"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "And how are you this evening?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "You can't lock me in!"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="3"&gt;3. "Give me a break, I was chased by mercenaries this morning."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[43] sw&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Privy&#x000A;Not much more than a narrow closet, with a hole in the floor and a bench over it. At least it's more private than an alley.&#x000A;&#x000A;A narrow window over the bench provides some ventilation.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[44] climb through window&#x000A;You sneak a furtive glance back at the hallway, then step up onto the bench. It wobbles under your feet, and you grab the window sill to steady yourself.&#x000A;&#x000A;Then, holding your breath to keep from making a sound, you pull yourself up and through. The window is at ground level outside, and you wriggle out onto the slick cobblestones.&#x000A;&#x000A;You're free! Of course, the widows will find out you're gone soon enough - Maiden House is not a very big place, after all. But you've snuck out before, and they know you can take care of yourself. At worst, you'll pull extra laundry duty for a few days.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind Maiden House&#x000A;This tiny spur of an alleyway runs between the back of Maiden House and the high stone wall surrounding the park. You can make your way around to the Maiden House Entrance to the northeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[45] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Entrance to Maiden House&#x000A;The alley dead-ends in a small courtyard surrounded by old, run-down buildings.&#x000A;&#x000A;The door to Maiden House is closed.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[46] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Back Alley&#x000A;A little-known shortcut between Lord's Market and the less affluent neighborhoods of the city's south end. A narrow street to the southwest leads to Maiden House, or you can return to the market square to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[47] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Lords Market&#x000A;At night, lanterns hung from ornate posts light the empty square of Lord's Market. Their warm yellow glow seems to make the shadows in the alleys that much darker. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[48] w&#x000A;&#x000A;East Commerce Street&#x000A;The east end of Commerce Street winds through an upper-class residential neighborhood before ending up at Lord's Market. Behind spiked, iron fences stand the "city cottages" of Toresal's wealthy merchants and nobility, built tall and narrow to make the best use of limited real estate.&#x000A;&#x000A;Three stately houses are built close together on the north side of the road: Black Gate Estate to the northwest; Red Gate Estate to the north; and the Jacobs family mansion to the northeast. The street itself continues east and west, and the City Park lies to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Commerce Street&#x000A;Commerce Street at night is eerily quiet and empty. Your footsteps seem to echo on the cobbles as you walk past the shuttered shopfronts. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[50] w&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Grubber's Market&#x000A;At night, the normally crowded marketplace is an empty maze of shadows, abandoned stalls and rolled-up canvas. The Lord's Road lies north, your little alley lies northwest, and Commerce Street lies back east.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is standing in the middle of Grubber's Market, under the shadow of the center post. &#x000A;&#x000A;When you get closer, he walks over and claps you on the shoulder. "Had a spot of trouble getting away from the Maidens, eh, Jack?" he whispers.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Not really."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "I had to sneak out."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[51] test adventure&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[52] n&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;You're too filled with nervous excitement to chit-chat; you want to get on with the adventure! With a grin, you walk right past Bobby without answering towards the gate out of town.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby cocks an eyebrow at you "Well, okay then," he mutters, and hurries to catch up.&#x000A;&#x000A;Lord's Road&#x000A;The wide and well-paved Lord's Road runs from Grubber's Market straight north to Lord's Keep, a mile or so from the city. To the east are rolling pastures; to the west, broken ground and scrub.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby jerks his thumb down the road, to the north. "This road leads straight to the front gate of Lord's Keep; we want to stay away from there. I know a better way," he says with a knowing smile, and strikes off towards the open field to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[53] e&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Pasture&#x000A;This wide, open field is used by the city for tourneys and other holiday events, or by cattle-sellers driving their livestock to market. Tonight it is empty except for the occasional cow pie. To the north you can see the dark, rough edge of a forest.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is here, waiting for you. &#x000A;&#x000A;You feel nervous and exposed out here in all this empty space; you're more used to the narrow alleys and enclosing walls of the city. The urge to hunch over and make yourself small is near-irresistible.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby, meanwhile, strides out into the middle of the moonlit field, standing straight and swinging his arms wide. "Fresh air, Jack!" he calls out, laughing. "Enjoy it! Take a deep breath!" He heads north, still laughing.&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[54] n&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Stream Crossing&#x000A;A small stream bubbles out of the woods and cuts through the pasture's north end. The edge of the forest lies to the north, just across the water. The city is far away to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is here, waiting for you. &#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby hops nimbly across, bouncing from rock to rock as though he were playing a game of Circles-and-Stones in the park. He doesn't get so much as the hem of his cloak damp. When he gets to the opposite bank, he turns and beckons you to follow before disappearing into the shadowy woods.&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[55] xyzzy&#x000A;A hollow voice whispers "groo."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[56] n&#x000A;The first couple of rocks are easy enough, but the third one wobbles when you put your weight on it. You end up pinwheeling your arms desperately, contorting yourself in every direction to avoid a tumble and a thorough soaking. Finally, with arms outstretched and lower lip clamped between your teeth, you pick your way across the remainder of the stream with all the grace of a drunkard on a greased tightrope.&#x000A;&#x000A;At the edge of the woods, Bobby is nearly doubled over with silent laughter. He claps you on the back. "You're a good sport, Jack," he says. "C'mon, we're nearly there."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Woods&#x000A;You are in the woodlands just southeast of Lord's Keep, following the game trails that wind their way through strands of pale birch and black spruce. There is just enough moonlight trickling through the upper branches to see your way by.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is here, waiting for you. &#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby motions you over to where he's standing, pushing back the underbrush. "Look here, Jack," he says. "These trails go every which way, and it's easy to get lost. But if you keep an eye out for this one sapling," -he points to a small tree split halfway down its length- "...you'll find the right trail." He heads off through the trees to the north.&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[57] unxyzzy&#x000A;A hollow voice whispers "oorg."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[58] n&#x000A;Clearing&#x000A;The woods open out here in a small, moonlit clearing. The ruins of an old pavilion lie here, pale pavestones poking up like bones from the grass.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is here, waiting for you. &#x000A;&#x000A;In the center of the clearing stands a crumbling fountain, topped by a cracked statue of the Goddess Brigid.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Here we are." Bobby jumps up into the bowl of the fountain, dried leaves crackling beneath his boots. Then he reaches around the statue of Brigid as though trying to embrace her. His hands fumble at something on the underside of the urn.&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly there is a deep, solid thunk and a scraping sound, and part of the base of the statue moves.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby hops down and pushes against the statue's base. A rectangle of stone about two feet square swings inward. The space behind it is utterly black, and a cold draft of damp-smelling air rises out of it.&#x000A;&#x000A;"It runs all the way to Lord's Keep," says Bobby as he brushes off his hands. "I don't think anyone knows about it. Maybe Lord Toresal did, but now that he's dead it's basically unknown. It's not been used for decades, I'd guess. Well anyway, until now."&#x000A;&#x000A;He holds out his hand. His lop-sided smile is absolutely charming. "After you, kind sir."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[59] d&#x000A;You grope your way down into the tunnel, carefully sliding your feet over steps you cannot see. Echoes fill the darkness: the scrape of your shoes on stone, the drip of water, your own loud breathing.&#x000A;&#x000A;Behind you, you hear Bobby fumbling with something under his cloak; the click of stone on metal; and then a sickly orange glow spreads across the walls of the tunnel. Your own shadow wobbles hugely in front of you.&#x000A;&#x000A;You turn around and see Bobby holding a torch. He grins at you. "Tricky, isn't it?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Underneath The Fountain&#x000A;The walls and floor are old, damp, and spotted with some sort of whitish fungus, and the air has a wet, sour smell to it. Steps lead up to the fountain above you. To the north, a long, low-ceilinged tunnel leads into the gloom.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is here, waiting for you. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[60] n&#x000A;Ducking your head to avoid the low ceiling, you follow the tunnel for some distance.&#x000A;&#x000A;Tunnel End&#x000A;The tunnel ends here at a blank, stone wall.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby steps past you and brushes his fingertips across the stonework, holding the torch close. Eventually he finds a loose brick and pulls it free, revealing a rough, rectangular hole.&#x000A;&#x000A;You wonder how many times Bobby has been down here. He exudes such easy confidence as he reaches into the hole, as though he has done this many times before.&#x000A;&#x000A;There is a click. Bobby looks over his shoulder at you and winks. And then the wall swings away, revealing shadowed spaces beyond.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[61] n&#x000A;Bobby jams his torch into a rusted bracket on the tunnel wall and steps through the secret door, gesturing you to follow. A prickle runs down your back as you step through after him. Are you really sneaking into the Lord's Keep? You're not even sure what the punishment for that is... something a lot worse than a few days in jail, certainly.&#x000A;&#x000A;Chapel&#x000A;The chapel of the Goddesses is a spacious, octagonal room, empty of furniture. The wood-paneled walls glow warmly, reflecting the light from dozens of devotional candles; the high ceiling disappears in the shadows overhead. A corridor leads southwest, and a secret passage in the south wall leads into subterranean gloom.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[62] sw&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The Lord's Guards" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Lower Bailey&#x000A;A thick wedge of shadow falls across the courtyard at the base of the Keep's outer wall, providing a relatively safe place to hide. The rest of the courtyard is flooded with moonlight, and bored-looking guards stroll back and forth over the gravel. You can enter another part of the castle to the northeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby moves up quietly behind you. He puts his mouth very, very close to your ear and whispers, "Up there," pointing to the steps leading up to the top of the wall.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[63] u&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;You wait, watching the nearest guard until he turns and begins walking away, then sprint lightly up the steps.&#x000A;&#x000A;Upper Bailey&#x000A;At the top of the wall you can lean out over the parapets and take in all the lands surrounding Toresal. It's a nice view, but torches set every few yards along the wall make this a dangerous spot to linger in. Stairs lead down into the courtyard below, and a dark archway opens to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[64] n&#x000A;Guardhouse&#x000A;A narrow antechamber, with an open archway to the south and an iron-reinforced door to the north. Arrow slits to either side lend the door an important and dangerous air.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby creeps forward and presses himself against the wall next to one of the arrow slits. He hunches closer, peering around the slit's edge. Then he looks up at you and smiles. He points at you, points at the arrow slit, then taps his ear. Listen, he's telling you.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[65] listen at slit&#x000A;You can hear several voices coming from the room on the other side of the arrow slit - guards relaxing on break, probably.&#x000A;&#x000A;"...and I says, I don't care who hired you, people are tryin' to do honest business here, and you're steppin' on toes. Take yer men and hit the road, or else you can continue searchin' for yer urchin boy in the city jail. And this tough fellow, him so hard with his sword and his scars and all, he just starts to cry, blubberin' like a frightened scullery maid!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Haw! Yer lyin', so you are!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Goddesses witness it, 'tis the truth! I could hardly credit it meself, and I weren't that impressed with the man to begin with. Go on, I says, and gave him a boot to the fundament to send him on his way."&#x000A;&#x000A;There is general laughter. You glance at Bobby, but he motions you to keep listening.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[66] listen to slit&#x000A;"You seen tomorrow's detail yet?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah, dress-up duty. Polishing helmets so we can look all pretty for the lords and ladies coming down to Baron Fussypants' ball."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Not just lords and ladies, I heard. Word has it the Queen herself is on the guest list, and she's expected to appear."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh, pull the other one."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Goddesses witness it. They say she's comin' down with her daughter in tow, that's why Fossville's hostin' the ball in the first place. He's tryin' to get in the Queen's good graces, so's he can marry the girl."&#x000A;&#x000A;"What, the Queen?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"No, you dim. He wants to marry the Princess. Our Lord Fussypants is trying to position himself for the throne."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Well, he's welcome to it, long as I'm paid at week's end. Of course, I'm not looking forward to spending a night standing at attention for a horde of fancy, feathered fops to goggle and gaggle at, but I guess it's better than latrine duty..."&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby pulls you away. He's grinning, his eyes wide and his eyebrows cocked. Isn't it great?&#x000A;&#x000A;But you're too nervous to care. There are who knows how many men of the Lord's Guard right on the other side of that door. Someone could walk out at any second. You grab Bobby's arm and give it a firm yank - It's time to go.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[67] s&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Upper Bailey&#x000A;At the top of the wall you can lean out over the parapets and take in all the lands surrounding Toresal. It's a nice view, but torches set every few yards along the wall make this a dangerous spot to linger in. Stairs lead down into the courtyard below, and a dark archway opens to the north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[68] d&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The Lord's Guards" /&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Lower Bailey&#x000A;A thick wedge of shadow falls across the courtyard at the base of the Keep's outer wall, providing a relatively safe place to hide. The rest of the courtyard is flooded with moonlight, and bored-looking guards stroll back and forth over the gravel. You can enter another part of the castle to the northeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[69] ne&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Chapel&#x000A;The chapel of the Goddesses is a spacious, octagonal room, empty of furniture. The wood-paneled walls glow warmly, reflecting the light from dozens of devotional candles; the high ceiling disappears in the shadows overhead. A corridor leads southwest, and a secret passage in the south wall leads into subterranean gloom.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[70] s&#x000A;Tunnel End&#x000A;The wall at the north end of the tunnel has swung open, revealing a secret entrance to the castle.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby reaches back and pulls the secret door shut, carefully easing it the last few inches so that it doesn't slam. He puts the loose brick back in its place, just as before, and tugs his torch free of the bracket where he'd left it.&#x000A;&#x000A;We're out, you realize with a sense of overwhelming relief. We made it. It's like we were never here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Some adventure, eh, Jack?" laughs Bobby. His voice is disturbingly loud after the long minutes of terrified silence in the keep. "Eavesdropping on the Lord's own guardsmen! That's a story that'll have the little ones wide-eyed at the Maiden House, eh?" He claps you on the back, and you manage a smile. It was fun, and you want Bobby to think you had fun, but it will be a while before you feel up to something that dangerous again.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[71] s&#x000A;Stealthily, you creep back up the long tunnel to the stone steps under the fountain. "I'll go up first," whispers Bobby, "to make sure the coast is clear." He dunks his torch in a puddle of mud and bounds lightly up the steps. For a moment you can see him silhouetted against the starlight; then he moves away from the opening and disappears from view.&#x000A;&#x000A;You wait for ten heartbeats. Behind you, you hear the distant plip of dripping moisture, far back in the dark tunnel. Above you, you can hear crickets chirping in the nearby forest.&#x000A;&#x000A;Ten more heartbeats. "Bobby?" you call out in a hoarse whisper. Maybe he can't hear you, but you're too nervous to raise your voice. "Bobby? Are you up there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;There is no answer.&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[72] u&#x000A;You crawl out of the hole in the base of the statue, into the dirt and leaves littering the bottom of the fountain. Apart from your scrabbling, it's quiet out here - very quiet.&#x000A;&#x000A;Even the crickets have stopped, you realize. Finally, you get to your feet and look around.&#x000A;&#x000A;Bobby is lying face-down in the grass, just a few yards away. One of the mercenaries from Grubber's Market is kneeling with his knee in the small of Bobby's back, binding his wrists together with twine. Standing around the outside of the fountain are several more mercenaries, looking relaxed and smug. Some of them are chuckling to themselves.&#x000A;&#x000A;A gaunt man wearing red robes walks up to you. His mouth is half-hidden by long, drooping, black moustaches, but underneath them he is smiling like a snake. "Well now, young...sir? Or is it 'miss'? So much confusion, all to catch one little mouse. You led us a merry chase this morning, little mouse, but I think you will not scurry away from us again."&#x000A;&#x000A;Leaves crunch behind you. You jump for it, but too slow - rough hands haul you back, and a sack of coarse, black cloth is pulled over your head.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Good night, little mouse."&#x000A;&#x000A;Something hard and heavy strikes the back of your head, and the night turns black as pitch.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Please press SPACE to continue.</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Slowly the world comes back to you. You feel something cold and hard against your cheek; something gritty and scratchy under your hand. You hear footsteps on stone, muttering voices that fade in and out. Someone laughs, a raw, cruel sound. A loud squeak, and an echoing, metallic crash. The footsteps fade away.&#x000A;&#x000A;You open your eyes. It's still dark.&#x000A;&#x000A;No, it's just dim. Dim light trickles in from somewhere above you.&#x000A;&#x000A;You sit up, and a tender spot on the back of your head throbs. Red and purple splotches bloom in front of your eyes, then fade away. After a moment or two, your head clears, and you can see where you are.&#x000A;&#x000A;Holding Cell&#x000A;A dank, cramped, foul-smelling cell. A pair of ragged burlap blankets and a few lumps of filthy straw litter the floor. The door is to the north. &#x000A;&#x000A;A hulking shape squats in the corner, staring at you with bloodshot eyes. &#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The hulking shape" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;Chapter 3 - Jail&#x000A;&gt;[73] test jail&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[74] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[75] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The hulking shape" /&gt;&lt;Character Name="Bobby" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;Suddenly you hear a voice whisper your name. "Jack..."&#x000A;&#x000A;At first you think it's the creepy guy in the corner, but he hasn't moved. You're still staring at him when the whisper comes again, louder this time: "Jack..." It's coming from somewhere outside the cell.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Bobby? Is that you?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[76] 1&#x000A;You rush up and press your face against the viewing window, but you can't see anything out there except an empty room. "Bobby?" you call, trying to keep the fear out of your voice. "Bobby, is that you? I'm locked in here, Bobby, help me!"&#x000A;&#x000A;The voice chuckles, then coughs weakly. "I'm in the cell next to yours, Jack. I'm locked in, too. Sorry."&#x000A;&#x000A;Your heart sinks a little at that, but at least being trapped in a cell with Bobby nearby is a little bit better than being trapped in a cell with no one around to help you at all... right?&#x000A;&#x000A;"Jack, listen," Bobby says. His voice is ragged and hoarse; you're worried that the mercenaries might have hurt him badly. "I'm going to get us out of this mess, don't worry. But in case I'm not able to meet up with you after, you need to listen carefully."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "What do you mean?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[77] 1&#x000A;"Not able to meet up with me?" you whisper, dismayed. "What do you mean? What-" but Bobby cuts you off.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Jack, listen to me. Go to Fossville's estate in the city. Use the rooftops. There's an alley behind the shops on Commerce Street where you can climb up."&#x000A;&#x000A;"You want me to break into Baron Fossville's house?" you whisper back, incredulously. "Bobby, I don't understand-"&#x000A;&#x000A;"He has secrets," Bobby goes on, "that you need to know. Secrets about your father."&#x000A;&#x000A;You pause, stunned.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Look for a letter-" says Bobby, but he is cut off by a door slamming open elsewhere in the room. Guards move past your cell door; one of them slams a wooden cudgel against the bars right in front of your face, and you stagger back.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Bobby"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Bobby, what's happening?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[78] 1&#x000A;"Bobby?" you cry, "Bobby? What's happening? What letter?"&#x000A;&#x000A;You hear a metallic rattling, the squeak of hinges. Then several meaty thuds, mixed with grunts and cries of pain. The guards reappear, this time dragging Bobby with them. He looks up as he passes the viewing window, and you get a brief glimpse of his face - bruised, bloody, but still smiling. You'd swear he was trying to wink at you, except that his eye is swollen shut.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Fossville, Jack!" he yells as they bundle him off. "The rooftops! Look for the letter!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Somewhere a door slams one final time... and then everything is silent.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="The hulking shape" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[79] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly the shadowy man in the corner puts his huge, thick-fingered hands on his knees and pushes himself up. "Well," he grunts in a thick, rough voice, "now that the guards are busy takin care of him..." the man stretches, glances at you, and smiles. It is not a friendly smile.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hi, kid. Name's Jacobs."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Jacobs"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "My name's Jack."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "Stay away from me!"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="3"&gt;3. "Do you know any way to get out of here?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[80] 3&#x000A;"Do you, uh...," you clear your throat, "...do you know some way we could get out of this place?"&#x000A;&#x000A;Jacobs raises an eyebrow. "Well now, little runt. I suppose I do."&#x000A;&#x000A;The hulking man walks over to the cell door and squints at it for a while, standing with his hands on his hips. "My father'll have me out of here by tomorrow, of course," he mutters, "but I don't like to wait that long." He barely looks at you - in fact, you're not sure that he's talking to you at all. It's more like he's just muttering to himself.&#x000A;&#x000A;He bends over and digs something out of the side of his boot, then stands up and thrusts his hand through the viewing window. He curses and strains to push his arm through, but the bars are too narrowly spaced - he can't reach out past his elbow. "Damn," he mutters, "didn't expect this..."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[81] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;Jacobs' face reddens with effort. "C'mon... c'mon..." he mutters.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Aaah! Goddesses curse it!" Jacobs jerks his hand back, rubbing his wrist.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Well, you gonna help me, runt, or not?" he asks, and holds out a short, stiff piece of wire, pinched between his thumb and forefinger.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Jacobs"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "What is that thing?"&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "I'd rather not."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="3"&gt;3. "Okay."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[82] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[83] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[84] 3&#x000A;"Um, okay," you say, and pluck the wire from his thick, calloused fingers.&#x000A;&#x000A;"That's the spirit, runt!" Jacobs says. Suddenly he comes over and puts his huge hands around your waist, hoisting you up as though you weighed no more than a sack of feathers. He feels strong enough to snap you in half.&#x000A;&#x000A;"You ever pick a lock before, runt?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Jacobs"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Yes."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "No."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[85] 1&#x000A;You manage a nod. It's sort of true... Bobby showed you a few tricks once, and you've practiced on an old padlock. But you've never tried to pick an actual working lock on an actual door before.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Good," Jacob says, pushing you up against the viewing window. "This one should be easy, long as you can reach it."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[86] unlock door with wire&#x000A;You slip your arm through the bars and reach down for the lock. It's a stretch - Jacobs has to lift you higher and press your shoulder painfully against the bars - but soon you feel the metal of the lockplate, and your fingers find the tiny, sharp-edged hole in the middle.&#x000A;&#x000A;You jam the end of the lockpick in and start wiggling it around. Almost immediately, you realize that this is not going to work. The angle is too awkward, and you can't see what you're doing, and you can't feel the tumblers the way Bobby showed you when you practiced on the front door of Maiden House...&#x000A;&#x000A;Then you feel the wire bump against something inside the lock. You manage to lever the end of the wire under something and push... you feel it start to give... you push a little harder, and it starts to pivot... you push harder, and it starts to slip off the end of your pick...&#x000A;&#x000A;And then there is a snap, and the pick jumps out of your fingers and tumbles to the ground outside the cell door.&#x000A;&#x000A;Jacobs puts you down. He puts his hand on the door... and pushes it open.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Well," he says, looking you over with a sly expression, "you are a valuable runt, after all."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[87] n&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Jailhouse&#x000A;The jailhouse is hardly more comfortable than the cells themselves, just a crude, small room of unfinished stone, with a wooden bench and table for the guards. Cells are south, west, and north. A foul smell comes from a tiny alcove to the southwest, and a passageway to the east leads out.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a lockpick here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Jacobs" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Jacobs arrives from the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;Jacobs turns to you. "I heard what your friend in the other cell said, before they dragged him out," he says. "Sounds like Fossville's taken quite an interest in you."&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList Character="Jacobs"&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="1"&gt;1. "Yes, he has."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;Topic ID="2"&gt;2. "I don't know what you're talking about."&lt;/Topic&gt;&#x000A;&lt;/TopicList&gt;&#x000A;&gt;[88] get wire&#x000A;Taken.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[89] unlock north door with wire&#x000A;"Fine, then," Jacobs snarls, "good luck getting past the guards, runt." He turns on his heel and stalks out, leaving you alone with the other prisoners.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;TopicList /&gt;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;Picking a lock is much easier when you're standing on the ground and can see what you're doing. Twenty seconds, and you have the cell door open.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh, thank you, miss, thank you kindly. Goddesses" blessings upon you. Allow me to make introductions," the man wheezes. "I am called Olmer, and this is my associate, Darrens." The skinny man standing behind him smiles and nods enthusiastically.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Now," says Olmer, "if you will follow us, we will make our escape."&#x000A;&#x000A;Olmer and Darrens go southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[90] sw&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;Character Name="Darrens" /&gt;&lt;Character Name="Olmer" /&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;&#x000A;Drain Room&#x000A;This tiny alcove reeks worse than the privy back at Maiden House, and that's saying something. The main room is back to the northeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;Set into the stone floor is a metal grate.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can also see Darrens and Olmer here.&#x000A;&#x000A;"The guards use this place to relieve themselves," Olmer explains, "and sometimes for beatin' prisoners when they don't feel like moppin' the cells after. My back's not much for physical labor, but a spry one like yourself should have little trouble." He motions for you to lift up the grate.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[91] lift grate&#x000A;It's a strain, but you're just barely able to lift the heavy grate and drop it to the side with a dull clang. Olmer smiles and gestures towards the foul-smelling hole. "After you," he wheezes.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[92] test sewers&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[93] xyzzy&#x000A;A hollow voice whispers "groo."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[94] down&#x000A;Well, it can't be that much worse than rotting in prison, you think. You sit down and dangle your feet over the edge of the hole. You can hear the sound of running water, and smell the sharp stink of sewage. You offer a quick prayer to Brigid - Please give me a chance to clean up before seeing Bobby again - take a deep breath, and drop down into darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Sewer&#x000A;The tunnels down here are made of ancient, unmortared brick, slimy with centuries of filth and mold. Dim light trickles down through narrow vents in the ceiling. Side tunnels split off in numerous directions, twisting away into darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Painted on the walls are a number of odd symbols.&#x000A;&#x000A;Olmer drops down into the muck next to you, followed by Darrens. "Now then, miss, cast your eye at these glyphs here," whispers Olmer. His voice echoes off into the blackness as he brushes the rough stone with his fingertips. "These are marked down by such poor blokes as have to take refuge down here on a more regular basis. They tells you where the tunnels lead, if you but know their language." Darrens nods in solemn agreement.&#x000A;&#x000A;"To get back to your neighborhood, you'll want to follow the red, see?" Olmer points off down the south tunnel. "Darrens and I, we must be off elsewhere, so we'll take our leave of you now. But follow the red and you can't go wrong."&#x000A;&#x000A;"It was very kind of you to set us free, young lady." He shakes your hand. (His hands are slimy with filth, but then so are yours.) "We've only our meagre gratitude with which to repay you, but we won't forget your generosity." Darrens nods vigorously and shakes as well.&#x000A;&#x000A;And then the two of them slosh off, leaving you alone.&#x000A;&#x000A;&lt;CharacterList&gt;&lt;/CharacterList&gt;Chapter 4 - Sewer&#x000A;&gt;[95] s&#x000A;Sewer&#x000A;The tunnels down here are made of ancient, unmortared brick, slimy with centuries of filth and mold. Dim light trickles down through narrow vents in the ceiling. Side tunnels split off in numerous directions, twisting away into darkness.&#x000A;&#x000A;Painted on the walls are a number of odd symbols.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[96] u&#x000A;You can't go that way.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[97] unxyzzy&#x000A;A hollow voice whispers "oorg."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[98] test rooftops&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[99] n&#x000A;Suddenly you find yourself in a tunnel where there are no symbols painted anywhere. You try to retrace your steps, but you must have taken a wrong turn somewhere, because now you can't find any symbols anywhere. All of the tunnels look alike; you are completely turned around and don't even know which direction you are stumbling in.&#x000A;&#x000A;The next tunnel you take leads you to an area with no vents - it is pitch black. You slip as you turn around and fall into the water. Something slick and wriggly brushes past your face, and you thrash to your feet.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can't see any light, anywhere. You don't know what direction you just came from. Cold, smelly water numbs your feet. Despair and paralyzing panic close in on you as you realize that you have no means of finding your way through this labyrinth.&#x000A;&#x000A;You are stuck down here, blind in the stinking blackness, forever.&#x000A;&#x000A;Sewer&#x000A;The tunnels down here are made of ancient, unmortared brick, slimy with centuries of filth and mold. Dim light trickles down through narrow vents in the ceiling.
