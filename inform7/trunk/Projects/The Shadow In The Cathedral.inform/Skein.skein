When the monks took me, aged six months, into their care, they named me Wren. Maybe because I was small, insignificant, and happy to eat any crumbs they threw my way. But these days I&apos;m Wren, 2nd Assistant Clock Polisher... and that&apos;s a role that&apos;s about as important in the workings of the Cathedral of Time as the large deaf man who re-stretches the worn-out springs.

&quot;HEY WREN!&quot;

Uh-oh.

&quot;We&apos;ve got a job for you!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, a promotion!&quot;

This, coming from Drake and Calvin, means something horrible is about to happen.

&quot;You&apos;ve got your rag, don&apos;t you?&quot;

&quot;And your polish?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I bleat, holding up the glass tumbler they&apos;ve given me.

&quot;Course you do. Well, we&apos;ve got something for you to do.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; chimes Calvin.

One on each arm, they march me down the hall, towards the Abbot&apos;s door. Am I in trouble? Going to be thrown out of the Cathedral?

&quot;On three!&quot; shouts Drake.

&quot;Tick!&quot; Calvin counts. &quot;Tick! Tock!&quot;

They shove me through the door. I fall into the Abbot&apos;s personal chamber. I might not know much about the Abbey but I do know that I really shouldn&apos;t be in here.

Abbot&apos;s Quarters
If I thought Abbots lived in luxury, then I was dead wrong. Even my attic&apos;s cozier than this. The Abbot&apos;s got no furniture at all, except a desk and a cot, and no decoration except for a bust of St. Newton. None of the axle-mounted, bevelled mobiles I was expecting. There&apos;s barely even any sunlight: one thin window to catch the sunrise, opposite the door to the hallway back west.

St. Newton is staring at the Abbot&apos;s unpolished Grandfather clock with a severe frown.

A few heartbeats measure a few seconds.

(Remember, you can type &quot;help&quot; if you need assistance.)

&quot;And don&apos;t come out till that clock&apos;s shining!&quot; shouts Drake from the hall.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Calvin says. &quot;It&apos;s got to look as good as if we did it!&quot;

&quot;Idiot,&quot; Drake mutters. &quot;Come on.&quot;

Their voices disappear down the hall.

&gt;[2] w
Curses to counterweights! It&apos;s not on my rota, this clock, so why should I finish off my polish on it? I head for the doorway - then freeze. Voices, coming down the hall. It&apos;s the Abbot Gubbler himself, coming this way!

(Remember, you can type &quot;help&quot; if you need assistance.)

&gt;[3] hide in clock
(first opening Gubbler&apos;s Grandfather clock)
(The help system will now turn off its reminder, but you can always type &quot;help&quot; at any time.)

&quot;We&apos;ll talk in here,&quot; I hear the Abbot saying, from right outside the door. &quot;More private. More quiet. Much better.&quot; The old man steps inside the room, followed by a tall figure in grey. In the last tick before his old eyes can see me, I dive inside the gigantic clock case and pull closed the door.

Inside Clock Case
As the phrase goes, I&apos;m stuck between a rack and a gear-trace; except here I&apos;m in the narrow gap between the clock case door and the heavy swinging penduluum behind. And if I get in the way of that, and disrupt the clock&apos;s holy timings... well, there&apos;s no way they wouldn&apos;t notice when the clock-hands stopped moving, let&apos;s just say.

A little light shines in through the keyhole, which is almost covered by the Abbot&apos;s spare robe hanging inside the case.

Oh, no... That click outside was the sound of the Abbot closing the door. Looks like he - and the grey figure I glimpsed with him - are going to be here for a while... And if they find me here, I&apos;ll be unwound!

&gt;[4] put tumbler on door
Oh... well, then. I tip out the last of the polish onto the floor of the clock. At least that part will shine.

I put the glass tumbler carefully against the door, then lean down to press my ear against it. Fantastic! I can hear much more clearly now!

&quot;I told you now didn&apos;t I tell you?&quot; old Abbot Gubbler is saying, plaintively. &quot;Here? Why here? You shouldn&apos;t have come here.&quot;

The Figure says something in reply. With the glass, I can hear quite clearly. That was a good idea. &quot;We have been disappointed with your failure. The cause and effect principle, Abbot. Such failure must bring consequences.&quot;

&gt;[5] z
Time moves on.

&quot;But these things, these things are not always tick-tock, they never are,&quot; the old man replies. His voice is quivering, quite different from the steady drone he has when intoning in Chapel. &quot;The - item you asked about - it&apos;s in the Vaults, you see? The Vaults. Even if I could get in, I ...&quot;

&quot;Your excuses we find disappointing. Very disappointing. More of this and, Abbot, we may need to unslip your gears completely.&quot;

&gt;[6] z
The Universal Clock moves onwards: time happens.

The Abbot is spluttering and choking. I&apos;ve seen him like this only once, when as a young foundling I dropped and smashed an altimeter right before the Archbishop was due to visit.

The Figure continues. &quot;Clearly you&apos;re too old to steal the item for us. We have a better mechanism for obtaining it. But you must provide us with the opportunity. Is that understood?&quot;

The Abbot nods violently, shaking out agreement the way I might beat dirt from a duster. &quot;My money?&quot; he asks.

&gt;[7] z
Tick tock.

For a moment, there&apos;s nothing more. Then the Figure says, all too clearly: &quot;You understand what you&apos;re doing? The Church will never recover from this.&quot;

Maybe the Abbot replies: just a badly-oiled squeak.

&gt;[8] z
Time moves on.

There&apos;s the clink, of a pouch of golden minutes. A heavy pouch. The Figure, paying the Abbot...? Then suddenly, there&apos;s a third voice. &quot;Sorry, Father, to interrupt, but you said...&quot;

It&apos;s a monk of the Abbey. &quot;Get out!&quot; the Abbot screeches. His bearing&apos;s lost its oil, it seems. &quot;Get out, get out!&quot;

&gt;[9] z
A few heartbeats measure a few seconds.

&quot;But Father,&quot; the monk continues, &quot;it&apos;s time, you know. You told me to tell you when it was time.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Of course of course,&quot; he mumbles. &quot;I&apos;ll... We&apos;ll continue this discussion later, then,&quot; he says, to the Figure.

&quot;We certainly will,&quot; the Figure replies.

The Abbot leaves, and that leaves me alone, inside this clock, with the stranger outside. He&apos;s coming nearer... I can hear his fingers on the door of the case! I must have nudged the penduluum, he must have seen the clock-hands quiver... but then, there&apos;s the swish of his cloak as he moves away, and the click as the door closes. Phew.

&gt;[10] out
I spill gratefully out of the clock, gasping for breath as though I&apos;ve been underwater. I&apos;ve just been holding it in, of course. As for what I&apos;ve heard - well, I probably shouldn&apos;t have, and the quicker I can get out of here, the better.

Abbot&apos;s Quarters
I need to get out of this place as fast as I can and without attracting any more attention. The door to the hallway is back west and as for polishing the Grandfather clock - well, forget it!

St. Newton is staring at the Abbot&apos;s unpolished Grandfather clock with a severe frown.

(I should probably explain: there are pendulums and penduluums. A weight on a string, that&apos;s a pendulum. Once it&apos;s put into a clock it is sanctified by the clockwork, it becomes a penduluum. Anyone can make or swing or polish a pendulum. Only the most holy can touch a penduluum.)

&gt;[11] open door
I haul open the door.

I can&apos;t stop thinking about that Figure in Grey. Stealing from the Vaults... I always knew Gubbler was a rat, even if he is the Abbot! But whatever they&apos;re up to, I&apos;m probably the only one who knows about it - which means I&apos;m the only one who can stop it. Cog&apos;s Teeth! I might get made a novice for it! Even better, a 1st Assistant Clock Polisher - then I&apos;d outrank Calvin and Drake!

&gt;[12] w
I&apos;m going to have to tell someone what I just heard. A theft, from the Vaults! But if the Abbot&apos;s involved - who else might be? After all, the figure he was talking to could have been anyone in the Abbey!

Corridor of Contemplation
The ancient stones of the Abbey rise to about shoulder-height before arching over, forcing me to bow my head in supplication before the Abbot&apos;s door, back east. To the west, I can hear the gentle echo of ticks and tocks coming from the Abbey&apos;s main hall.

Carved into the walls are a series of pious engravings, depicting the long path from initiate to Abbot.

&gt;[13] w
I dart out of the tunnel only to be stop-clocked by a depressing sight. It&apos;s Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey&apos;s Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.

&quot;Hey, you!&quot; Drake shouts. In a moment he&apos;s got me by the ear. &quot;What were you doing in the Abbot&apos;s room? That&apos;s not on your rota!&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Calvin adds. &quot;And why are you slipping away when we told you to stay there?&quot;

&quot;Idiot,&quot; Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, &quot;That&apos;s it, Wren. You&apos;re consigned to your room.&quot; For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.

&quot;Up you go,&quot; Calvin says. &quot;And you&apos;re not to come down till dark!&quot;

&quot;What about dinner?&quot; I ask.

&quot;Should have thought of that, shouldn&apos;t you?&quot; Drake says.

&quot;More for us,&quot; Calvin adds. &quot;Only two hours to go. I&apos;m starved.&quot;

With that, they punch me again until I scurry out of reach up the ladder.


*** CHAPTER 2: No Place to Hide ***

Attic Room
This isn&apos;t really an attic. It isn&apos;t really a room either. It&apos;s a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There&apos;s enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren&apos;t going to stop me from falling...

A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It&apos;s right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).

Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I&apos;ve overheard. Someone at the Cathedral would listen: I could tell the Archbishop himself, maybe. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I&apos;d broken. If only I could fly.

But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I&apos;m clever. Clockwise.

I dart out of the tunnel only to be stop-clocked by a depressing sight. It&apos;s Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey&apos;s Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.

&quot;Hey, you!&quot; Drake shouts. In a moment he&apos;s got me by the ear. &quot;What were you doing in the Abbot&apos;s room? That&apos;s not on your rota!&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Calvin adds. &quot;And why are you slipping away when we told you to stay there?&quot;

&quot;Idiot,&quot; Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, &quot;That&apos;s it, Wren. You&apos;re consigned to your room.&quot; For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.

&quot;Up you go,&quot; Calvin says. &quot;And you&apos;re not to come down till dark!&quot;

&quot;What about dinner?&quot; I ask.

&quot;Should have thought of that, shouldn&apos;t you?&quot; Drake says.

&quot;More for us,&quot; Calvin adds. &quot;Only two hours to go. I&apos;m starved.&quot;

With that, they punch me again until I scurry out of reach up the ladder.

This isn&apos;t really an attic. It isn&apos;t really a room either. It&apos;s a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There&apos;s enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren&apos;t going to stop me from falling...

A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It&apos;s right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).

Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I&apos;ve overheard. Someone at the Cathedral would listen: I could tell the Archbishop himself, maybe. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I&apos;d broken. If only I could fly.

But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I&apos;m clever. Clockwise.

&gt;[1] test intro
(Testing.)

&gt;[2] z
A few heartbeats measure a few seconds.

(Remember, you can type &quot;help&quot; if you need assistance.)

&quot;And don&apos;t come out till that clock&apos;s shining!&quot; shouts Drake from the hall.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Calvin says. &quot;It&apos;s got to look as good as if we did it!&quot;

&quot;Idiot,&quot; Drake mutters. &quot;Come on.&quot;

Their voices disappear down the hall.

&gt;[3] w
Curses to counterweights! It&apos;s not on my rota, this clock, so why should I finish off my polish on it? I head for the doorway - then freeze. Voices, coming down the hall. It&apos;s the Abbot Gubbler himself, coming this way!

(Remember, you can type &quot;help&quot; if you need assistance.)

&gt;[4] hide in clock
(first opening Gubbler&apos;s Grandfather clock)
(The help system will now turn off its reminder, but you can always type &quot;help&quot; at any time.)

&quot;We&apos;ll talk in here,&quot; I hear the Abbot saying, from right outside the door. &quot;More private. More quiet. Much better.&quot; The old man steps inside the room, followed by a tall figure in grey. In the last tick before his old eyes can see me, I dive inside the gigantic clock case and pull closed the door.

Inside Clock Case
As the phrase goes, I&apos;m stuck between a rack and a gear-trace; except here I&apos;m in the narrow gap between the clock case door and the heavy swinging penduluum behind. And if I get in the way of that, and disrupt the clock&apos;s holy timings... well, there&apos;s no way they wouldn&apos;t notice when the clock-hands stopped moving, let&apos;s just say.

A little light shines in through the keyhole, which is almost covered by the Abbot&apos;s spare robe hanging inside the case.

Oh, no... That click outside was the sound of the Abbot closing the door. Looks like he - and the grey figure I glimpsed with him - are going to be here for a while... And if they find me here, I&apos;ll be unwound!

&gt;[5] put tumbler on door
Oh... well, then. I tip out the last of the polish onto the floor of the clock. At least that part will shine.

I put the glass tumbler carefully against the door, then lean down to press my ear against it. Fantastic! I can hear much more clearly now!

&quot;I told you now didn&apos;t I tell you?&quot; old Abbot Gubbler is saying, plaintively. &quot;Here? Why here? You shouldn&apos;t have come here.&quot;

The Figure says something in reply. With the glass, I can hear quite clearly. That was a good idea. &quot;We have been disappointed with your failure. The cause and effect principle, Abbot. Such failure must bring consequences.&quot;

&gt;[6] z
Time moves on.

&quot;But these things, these things are not always tick-tock, they never are,&quot; the old man replies. His voice is quivering, quite different from the steady drone he has when intoning in Chapel. &quot;The - item you asked about - it&apos;s in the Vaults, you see? The Vaults. Even if I could get in, I ...&quot;

&quot;Your excuses we find disappointing. Very disappointing. More of this and, Abbot, we may need to unslip your gears completely.&quot;

&gt;[7] z
The Universal Clock moves onwards: time happens.

The Abbot is spluttering and choking. I&apos;ve seen him like this only once, when as a young foundling I dropped and smashed an altimeter right before the Archbishop was due to visit.

The Figure continues. &quot;Clearly you&apos;re too old to steal the item for us. We have a better mechanism for obtaining it. But you must provide us with the opportunity. Is that understood?&quot;

The Abbot nods violently, shaking out agreement the way I might beat dirt from a duster. &quot;My money?&quot; he asks.

&gt;[8] z
Tick tock.

For a moment, there&apos;s nothing more. Then the Figure says, all too clearly: &quot;You understand what you&apos;re doing? The Church will never recover from this.&quot;

Maybe the Abbot replies: just a badly-oiled squeak.

&gt;[9] z
Time moves on.

There&apos;s the clink, of a pouch of golden minutes. A heavy pouch. The Figure, paying the Abbot...? Then suddenly, there&apos;s a third voice. &quot;Sorry, Father, to interrupt, but you said...&quot;

It&apos;s a monk of the Abbey. &quot;Get out!&quot; the Abbot screeches. His bearing&apos;s lost its oil, it seems. &quot;Get out, get out!&quot;

&gt;[10] z
A few heartbeats measure a few seconds.

&quot;But Father,&quot; the monk continues, &quot;it&apos;s time, you know. You told me to tell you when it was time.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Of course of course,&quot; he mumbles. &quot;I&apos;ll... We&apos;ll continue this discussion later, then,&quot; he says, to the Figure.

&quot;We certainly will,&quot; the Figure replies.

The Abbot leaves, and that leaves me alone, inside this clock, with the stranger outside. He&apos;s coming nearer... I can hear his fingers on the door of the case! I must have nudged the penduluum, he must have seen the clock-hands quiver... but then, there&apos;s the swish of his cloak as he moves away, and the click as the door closes. Phew.

&gt;[11] out
I spill gratefully out of the clock, gasping for breath as though I&apos;ve been underwater. I&apos;ve just been holding it in, of course. As for what I&apos;ve heard - well, I probably shouldn&apos;t have, and the quicker I can get out of here, the better.

Abbot&apos;s Quarters
I need to get out of this place as fast as I can and without attracting any more attention. The door to the hallway is back west and as for polishing the Grandfather clock - well, forget it!

St. Newton is staring at the Abbot&apos;s unpolished Grandfather clock with a severe frown.

(I should probably explain: there are pendulums and penduluums. A weight on a string, that&apos;s a pendulum. Once it&apos;s put into a clock it is sanctified by the clockwork, it becomes a penduluum. Anyone can make or swing or polish a pendulum. Only the most holy can touch a penduluum.)

&gt;[12] open door
I haul open the door.

I can&apos;t stop thinking about that Figure in Grey. Stealing from the Vaults... I always knew Gubbler was a rat, even if he is the Abbot! But whatever they&apos;re up to, I&apos;m probably the only one who knows about it - which means I&apos;m the only one who can stop it. Cog&apos;s Teeth! I might get made a novice for it! Even better, a 1st Assistant Clock Polisher - then I&apos;d outrank Calvin and Drake!

&gt;[13] w
I&apos;m going to have to tell someone what I just heard. A theft, from the Vaults! But if the Abbot&apos;s involved - who else might be? After all, the figure he was talking to could have been anyone in the Abbey!

Corridor of Contemplation
The ancient stones of the Abbey rise to about shoulder-height before arching over, forcing me to bow my head in supplication before the Abbot&apos;s door, back east. To the west, I can hear the gentle echo of ticks and tocks coming from the Abbey&apos;s main hall.

Carved into the walls are a series of pious engravings, depicting the long path from initiate to Abbot.

&gt;[14] w
I dart out of the tunnel only to be stop-clocked by a depressing sight. It&apos;s Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey&apos;s Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.

&quot;Hey, you!&quot; Drake shouts. In a moment he&apos;s got me by the ear. &quot;What were you doing in the Abbot&apos;s room? That&apos;s not on your rota!&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Calvin adds. &quot;And why are you slipping away when we told you to stay there?&quot;

&quot;Idiot,&quot; Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, &quot;That&apos;s it, Wren. You&apos;re consigned to your room.&quot; For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.

&quot;Up you go,&quot; Calvin says. &quot;And you&apos;re not to come down till dark!&quot;

&quot;What about dinner?&quot; I ask.

&quot;Should have thought of that, shouldn&apos;t you?&quot; Drake says.

&quot;More for us,&quot; Calvin adds. &quot;Only two hours to go. I&apos;m starved.&quot;

With that, they punch me again until I scurry out of reach up the ladder.


*** CHAPTER 2: No Place to Hide ***

Attic Room
This isn&apos;t really an attic. It isn&apos;t really a room either. It&apos;s a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There&apos;s enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren&apos;t going to stop me from falling...

A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It&apos;s right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).

Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I&apos;ve overheard. Someone at the Cathedral would listen: I could tell the Archbishop himself, maybe. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I&apos;d broken. If only I could fly.

But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I&apos;m clever. Clockwise.

&gt;[15] test abbey-garden
(Testing.)

&gt;[16] d
I scramble quickly down the ladder.

Western Corner of the Great Hall
I&apos;m in the western corner of the Great Hall, just by the foot of the ladder up to my room (the rest of the hall is east). There&apos;s a note attached to the third rung asking Amble the caretaker not to put the ladder back in the garden just yet.

&gt;[17] e

Upper Hall
The Great Hall of the Abbey is the biggest room I&apos;ve seen in my life, running from this end all the way southwest to the other end of the Hall (and it is all the way - I&apos;m never allowed any further than the Great Doors and the Yard outside). If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder snakes down from one side, west of here. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.

From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should get out of the Cathedral and see the Archbishop as quickly as possible.

&gt;[18] sw

Central Hall
I&apos;m standing in the very centre of the Abbey&apos;s Great Hall. It&apos;s impossible not to crane my neck at the ceiling held aloft by buttresses the size of gigantic oak trees. To think, people built this in the days before real pulley-transmissions! It must have taken weeks! The hall continues northeast into shadow, and southwest, towards the sunlight, the Yard and above all, the Archbishop.

The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough. I can just make out archways both east and west.

Distantly - but not distantly enough - I can hear the Refectory Clock and clatter of Drake&apos;s boots. The sound&apos;s coming from the west.

&gt;[19] e

West Refectory
I spend some of my time here, eating at one of the two long tables. I spend even more serving the monks. Each of them has their own seat, marked by a little brass hourglass, and if the twenty or so I can see here weren&apos;t enough (which they aren&apos;t), there&apos;s more to the east, where the Refectory continues. Back west is the archway to the Great Hall.

On the table is a single empty teacup, left over from breakfast.

Drake&apos;s clattering boots are audible to the west.

&gt;[20] get cup
I pick up the empty cup from its place beside by Brother Horloge&apos;s hourglass.

Looking west, I can see Drake. He&apos;s coming this way! I can escape east.

&gt;[21] e

East Refectory
The eastern end of the long Refectory is given over in part to the tables lined with brass hourglasses, but in the other half there&apos;s nothing but the enormous Refectory Clock. It&apos;s an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after three o&apos;clock.

Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey&apos;s herb garden.

&gt;[22] n

Kitchen
If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it&apos;s that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen. Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing ... the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat are almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he&apos;s stone deaf. 

The cool of the Hall is west. South, through a broad arch, is the Refectory. North is the dark recess of the Pantry.

Drake&apos;s footsteps echo in from the south.

&gt;[23] put cup in bracket
I put the teacup into the bracket.

&gt;[24] hide in pantry
I duck into the pantry.

Abbey Pantry
The Pantry is as tiny as a clock-case and filled with shelves that smell of herb and oil - but it&apos;s dark enough to hide someone like me...

&gt;[25] s
I catch the sound of hobnailed boots from that direction. Drake&apos;s heading this way. I&apos;ll wait and let him pass.

&gt;[26] s
Just in time, I see Drake&apos;s there. I hang back. He&apos;ll move on in a moment.

I hear footsteps, moving away into the Abbey.

&gt;[27] smell
The strongest smell comes from the jar of tea leaf on the shelves.

&gt;[28] take leaf
I scoop up a handful of tea leaves.

The basket&apos;s now filled with tea leaves.

&gt;[31] x train
I can&apos;t help but notice a worn down gear in the middle of the train, no longer catching teeth with its fellows. I make the sign of Sad Depreciation.

The cook pushes past me, to respring the masher.

&gt;[32] get gear
(the small gear)
While the Cook is distracted - the Cook is always distracted - I pluck out the worn down gear. Not the sort of repair a clock polisher should be doing!

&gt;[33] turn spigot
The spigot releases a steady dribble of water into the kettle, filling it nicely. Across the room, the clouds coming from the steamer suddenly thin out.

The Cook stops and gives me the most evil of evil stares. I turn the spigot closed again.

&gt;[34] wind key
(the tea maker key)
A few turns and the spring is fully wound.

The cook bustles past me, to unclip the whisker.

&gt;[35] w

Upper Hall
If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder snakes down from one side, west of here. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.

From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should head southwest out of the Cathedral and see the Archbishop as quickly as possible.

&gt;[36] sw
Just in time, I see Drake&apos;s there. I hang back. He&apos;ll move on in a moment.

Footsteps - moving away.

&gt;[37] sw

Central Hall
I&apos;m standing in the very centre of the Abbey&apos;s Great Hall. The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough. I can just make out archways both east and west.

I hear footsteps, receding.

&gt;[38] sw

Lower Hall
Looking northeast, the Great Hall of the Abbey stretches away like the belly of some big beast, laid out ready to have its mouth stuffed with an apple. The walls are lit in Holy Patterns by candles on Sacred Tracks suspended in the air. There&apos;s just enough light to make out the Corridor of Contemplation to the east and the wider archway to the Scriptorium to the west.

But more importantly, the great Entry - and exit - of the Abbey is to the southwest. And if I&apos;m going to get out of here and talk to the Archbishop that&apos;s the only way to go.

But maybe you&apos;re starting to see what kind of luck I have. Right there, in the Entry, is Calvin, working on a clock.

&gt;[39] w

Scriptorium
The Scriptorium is where the Copying takes place, though it&apos;s hard to believe that Copying once meant a team of monks working with carved rubber stamps. It&apos;s all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There&apos;s the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh&apos;s Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I&apos;ll have to duck under it.

Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.

The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair. The Cabinet of Relics next to it is open.

&gt;[40] get new gear
&quot;Put that back,&quot; Reloh snaps, without looking up. But I don&apos;t put it back.

&gt;[41] ne

Library
The Abbey&apos;s library is small compared to the one in the Cathedral. There&apos;s nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey&apos;s Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he&apos;s here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.

An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.

Horloge looks up as I enter. &quot;Ah, young - young Whotsit!&quot; he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don&apos;t think he can quite see where I am. &quot;Look here!&quot; he demands. &quot;Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good... of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good.&quot; He smiles, then looks back down to his studies, muttering.

&gt;[42] take keys
Brother Horloge puts out a worn-out old hand. &quot;Now don&apos;t you wander off with my keys,&quot; he says. &quot;They&apos;re very important.&quot;

In one corner is the only machine I&apos;m allowed to use: the Tea Maker. In the bracket of the machine is a teacup. 

The cool of the Hall is west. South, through a broad arch, is the Refectory. North is the dark recess of the Pantry.

&gt;[49] put new gear in train
I slip the new gear into place. The gear train forms a perfect snake from the lever, over the semi-circular bracket and into the innards of the machine.

&gt;[50] pull lever
The gear train whirrs into life, swinging the kettle across inside the machine. Its base knocks open the gas-pipe tap. A jet of gas hisses out, blowing up a tiny sail attached by thread to the flint-iron. The burner is quickly alight.
