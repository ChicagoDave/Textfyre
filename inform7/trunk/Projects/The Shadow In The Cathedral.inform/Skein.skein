Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge looks up as I enter. "Ah, young - young Whotsit!" he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. "Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good."

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Not only have I disobeyed him, but I've done it twice. "I'm going to have your skin," he hisses into in my ear. "I'm going to use it as a cloak comes winter. Understand?" With that he drags me back off to my attic. This time, I can barely climb the stairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;A quick pause for breath and&#x2026; right then. I'm ready. I'm going to get out of the Abbey somehow, and warn the Archbishop. And I won't give up till I've got there!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair. The Cabinet of Relics next to it is open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The walls are carelessly lit by candles moving through Sacred Tracks suspended in the air. I can just make out the Corridor of Contemplation to the east, and the wider archway to the Scriptorium to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;But more importantly, the great Entry - and exit - of the Abbey is to the southwest.

Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing &#x2026; the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;I can escape back into the cool of the Hall to the west.

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall.

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room?

For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing &#x2026; the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;I can escape back into the cool of the Hall to the west.

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;I can see a picture here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Not only have I disobeyed him, but I've done it twice. "I'm going to have your skin," he hisses into in my ear. "I'm going to use it as a cloak comes winter. Understand?" With that he drags me back off to my attic. This time, I can barely climb the stairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;A quick pause for breath and&#x2026; right then. I'm ready.

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall.

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room?

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair.

Even my attic's cosier than this. The Abbot's got no furniture at all, except a desk and a cot, and no decoration except for a bust of St. Newton. None of the axle-mounted bevelled mobiles I was expecting. There's barely even any sunlight: one thin window to catch the sun-rise, opposite the door to the hallway back west.&#x000A;&#x000A;St. Newton is staring at the Abbot's unpolished Grandfather clock with a severe frown.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder is on one side, to the west. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should get out of the Cathedral and talk to the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It must have taken weeks! The hall continues northeast into shadow, and southwest, towards the sunlight, the Yard and above all, the Archbishop.&#x000A;&#x000A;The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough.

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder is on one side, to the west. Lights moves in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should get out of the Cathedral and talk to the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall.

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall.

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after 3pm.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden.&#x000A;&#x000A;Drake's just off to the west, and he's coming this way!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room?

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room."

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

And if that hit me, and disrupted the holy timings&#x2026; well, there's no way they wouldn't notice when the clock-hands stopped moving, let's just say.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little light shines in through the keyhole, which is almost covered by the Abbot's spare robe.&#x000A;&#x000A;Oh, no&#x2026; That click outside was the sound of the Abbot closing the door. Looks like he - and the grey figure I glimpsed with him - are going to be here for a while&#x2026;&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room?

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge reaches up to pet his owl. The bird is motionless.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge looks up as I enter. "Ah, young - young Whotsit!" he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. "Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good." He smiles, then looks back down to his studies, muttering.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It must have taken weeks!

It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

Even my attic's cosier than this. The Abbot's got no furniture at all, except a desk and a cot, and no decoration except for a bust of St. Newton. None of the axle-mounted bevelled mobiles I was expecting. There's barely even any sunlight: one thin window to catch the sun-rise, opposite the door to the hallway back west.&#x000A;&#x000A;St. Newton is staring at the Abbot's unpolished Grandfather clock with a severe frown.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair. The Cabinet of Relics next to it is open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

His bearing's lost its oil, it seems. "Get out, get out!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"But Father," the monk continues, "it's time, you know. You told me to tell you when it was time."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh!

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The walls are carelessly lit by candles moving through Sacred Tracks suspended in the air. I can just make out the Corridor of Contemplation to the east, and the wider archway to the Scriptorium to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;But more importantly, the great Entry - and exit - of the Abbey is to the southwest. And if I'm going to get out of here and talk to the Archbishop that's the only way to go.&#x000A;&#x000A;But maybe you're starting to see what kind of luck I have.

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall.

The surface is scratched a little with geometric designs. &#x000A;&#x000A;"And don't come out till that clock's shining!" shouts Drake from the hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah," Calvin says. "It's got to look as good as if we did it!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake mutters. "Come on."&#x000A;&#x000A;Their voices disappear down the hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[2] x designs&#x000A;I can't see any such thing.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[3] x scratches&#x000A;I can't see any such thing.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[4] x cot&#x000A;The Abbot's cot is a hard wooden pallet, with no pillow and one small blanket. "Mustn't sleep," I can hear him saying. "Time doesn't sleep. Sleep is our great weakness." &#x000A;&#x000A;The grandfather clock ticks off a minute with a stately thunk. Quickly, I make the sign of the winding gear.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[5] x blanket&#x000A;The Abbot's cot is a hard wooden pallet, with no pillow and one small blanket. "Mustn't sleep," I can hear him saying. "Time doesn't sleep. Sleep is our great weakness." &#x000A;&#x000A;From the hallway outside comes the echo of voices. Too shaky to be Calvin or Drake. More like - oh, no. It's the Abbot, coming back to his room. And if he finds me here, then my springs won't be worth the spindles they're sprung to...&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[6] x bust&#x000A;I can feel the well-fitted eyes of St. Newton gazing right down into my workings. Quickly, I make the sign of penduluum and look away. &#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot's voice is getting closer. The old man may move slower than a short hand, but he's definitely coming this way.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] x window&#x000A;The narrow-barred window catches the morning sunshine. The same sunshine that Drake and Calvin are out enjoying while I'm stuck in here. &#x000A;&#x000A;Oh, widdershins! Gubbler is right outside the door! I'd better hide somewhere!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] x door&#x000A;(the Abbot's Door)&#x000A;I see nothing special about the Abbot's Door.&#x000A;&#x000A;"We'll talk in here," I hear the Abbot saying, from right outside the door. "More private. More quiet. Much better." The old man steps inside the room, followed by a tall figure in grey. In the last tick before his old eyes can see me, I dive inside the gigantic clock case and pull closed the door.&#x000A;&#x000A;Inside Clock Case&#x000A;As the phrase goes, I'm stuck between a rack and a gear-trace; except here I'm in the narrow gap between the clock case door and the heavy swinging penduluum behind. And if that hit me, and disrupted the holy timings... well, there's no way they wouldn't notice when the clock-hands stopped moving, let's just say.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little light shines in through the keyhole, which is almost covered by the Abbot's spare robe.&#x000A;&#x000A;Oh, no... That click outside was the sound of the Abbot closing the door. Looks like he - and the grey figure I glimpsed with him - are going to be here for a while...&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] x pendulum&#x000A;The penduluum is a large amount of Holy Brass, properly blessed and bevelled. It swings back and forth, raising the weight of Precision against the counterweight of Slapdashery. &#x000A;&#x000A;"I told you now didn't I tell you?" old Abbot Gubbler is saying, plaintively. "Here? Why here? You shouldn't have come here."&#x000A;&#x000A;The Figure says something in reply. I can only hear two words, but they're enough to stop my heart. "Failure," and "Consequences."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] x weights&#x000A;I can't see any such thing.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] x weight of precision&#x000A;I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the penduluum.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] x counterweight&#x000A;The penduluum is a large amount of Holy Brass, properly blessed and bevelled. It swings back and forth, raising the weight of Precision against the counterweight of Slapdashery. &#x000A;&#x000A;"But these things, these things are not always tick-tock, they never are," the old man replies. His voice is quivering, quite different from the steady drone he has when intoning in Chapel. "The - item you asked about - it's in the Vaults, you see? The Vaults. Even if I could get in, I ..."&#x000A;&#x000A;The Figure is too far from the keyhole and speaks too quietly for me to hear clearly. "Disappointing," he says; and then "unslip your gears."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] x counterweight of slapdashery&#x000A;I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the penduluum.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] x figure&#x000A;The glimpse I caught earlier was a tall - man? - wearing a suit of grey leather and a long flowing cape. Now I can't see him at all - it's almost as though he knows I'm hiding, and he's avoiding the keyhole's line of sight. &#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot is spluttering and choking. I've seen him like this only once, when as a young initiate I dropped and smashed an altimeter right before the Archbishop was due to visit.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Figure's quiet voice continues. I can make out; "too old to steal", "a better mechanism", "the opportunity."&#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot nods violently, shaking out agreement the way I might beat dirt from a duster. "My money?" he asks.&#x000A;&#x000A;What? Steal? Money? This doesn't sound clockwise to me!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] x abbot&#x000A;I can't see much through the keyhole, except the Abbot's stout waist and shaking hands. Not much good for winding anything now, but if I said as much to anyone then I'd be in real trouble. &#x000A;&#x000A;There's the clink, of a pouch of golden minutes. A heavy pouch. The Figure, paying the Abbot...? Then suddenly, there's a third voice. "Sorry, Father, to interrupt, but you said..."&#x000A;&#x000A;It's a monk of the Abbey. "Get out!" the Abbot screeches. His bearing's lost its oil, it seems. "Get out, get out!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"But Father," the monk continues, "it's time, you know. You told me to tell you when it was time."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh! Of course of course," he mumbles. "I'll... We'll continue this discussion later, then," he says, to the Figure.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Figure intones something in reply.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot leaves, and that leaves me alone, inside this clock, with the stranger outside. He's coming nearer... I can hear his fingers on the door of the case! I must have nudged the penduluum, he must have seen the clock-hands quiver... but then, there's the swish of his cloak as he moves away, and the click as the door closes. Phew.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Now I can't see him at all - it's almost as though he knows I'm hiding, and he's avoiding the keyhole's line of sight. &#x000A;&#x000A;"But these things, these things are not always tick-tock, they never are," the old man replies. His voice is quivering, quite different from the steady drone he has when intoning in Chapel. "The - item you asked about - it's in the Vaults, you see? The Vaults. Even if I could get in, I ..."&#x000A;&#x000A;The Figure is too far from the keyhole and speaks too quietly for me to hear clearly. "Disappointing," he says; and then "unslip your gears."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Not much good for winding anything now, but if I said as much to anyone then I'd be in real trouble. &#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot is spluttering and choking. I've seen him like this only once, when as a young initiate I dropped and smashed an altimeter right before the Archbishop was due to visit.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Figure's quiet voice continues. I can make out; "too old to steal", "a better mechanism", "the opportunity."&#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot nods violently, shaking out agreement the way I might beat dirt from a duster. "My money?" he asks.&#x000A;&#x000A;What? Steal? Money? This doesn't sound clockwise to me!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

A heavy pouch. The Figure, paying the Abbot...? Then suddenly, there's a third voice. "Sorry, Father, to interrupt, but you said..."&#x000A;&#x000A;It's a monk of the Abbey. "Get out!" the Abbot screeches. His bearing's lost its oil, it seems. "Get out, get out!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"But Father," the monk continues, "it's time, you know. You told me to tell you when it was time."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh! Of course of course," he mumbles. "I'll... We'll continue this discussion later, then," he says, to the Figure.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Figure intones something in reply.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot leaves, and that leaves me alone, inside this clock, with the stranger outside. He's coming nearer... I can hear his fingers on the door of the case! I must have nudged the penduluum, he must have seen the clock-hands quiver... but then, there's the swish of his cloak as he moves away, and the click as the door closes. Phew.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Quickly, I make the sign of penduluum and look away. &#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot's voice is getting closer. The old man may move slower than a short hand, but he's definitely coming this way.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] x window&#x000A;The narrow-barred window catches the morning sunshine.

"More private. More quiet. Much better." The old man steps inside the room, followed by a tall figure in grey. In the last tick before his old eyes can see me, I dive inside the gigantic clock case and pull closed the door.&#x000A;&#x000A;Inside Clock Case&#x000A;As the phrase goes, I'm stuck between a rack and a gear-trace; except here I'm in the narrow gap between the clock case door and the heavy swinging penduluum behind. And if that hit me, and disrupted the holy timings... well, there's no way they wouldn't notice when the clock-hands stopped moving, let's just say.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little light shines in through the keyhole, which is almost covered by the Abbot's spare robe.&#x000A;&#x000A;Oh, no... That click outside was the sound of the Abbot closing the door. Looks like he - and the grey figure I glimpsed with him - are going to be here for a while...&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
