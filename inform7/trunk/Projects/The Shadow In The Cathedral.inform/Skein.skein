    <result xml:space="preserve">This game is equipped with a simple help system. Type help to learn more about Interactive Fiction.&#x000A;&#x000A;When the monks took me, aged six months, into their care, they named me Wren. Maybe because I was small, insignificant, and happy to eat any crumbs they threw my way. But these days I'm Wren, 2nd Assistant Clock Polisher... and that's a role that's about as important in the workings of the Cathedral of Time as the large deaf man who re-stretches the worn-out springs.&#x000A;&#x000A;"HEY WREN!"&#x000A;&#x000A;Uh-oh.&#x000A;&#x000A;"We've got a job for you!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah, a promotion!"&#x000A;&#x000A;This, coming from Drake and Calvin, means something horrible is about to happen.&#x000A;&#x000A;"You've got your rag, don't you?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"And your polish?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yes," I bleat, holding up the glass tumbler they've given me.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Course you do. Well, we've got something for you to do."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah," chimes Calvin.&#x000A;&#x000A;One on each arm, they march me down the hall, towards the Abbot's door. Am I in trouble? Going to be thrown out of the Cathedral?&#x000A;&#x000A;"On three!" shouts Drake.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Tick!" Calvin counts. "Tick! Tock!"&#x000A;&#x000A;They shove me through the door. I fall into the Abbot's personal chamber. I might not know much about the Abbey but I do know that I really shouldn't be in here.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Shadow In The Cathedral&#x000A;The Shadow In The Cathedral by Textfyre Inc&#x000A;Version 1.0.20091105Std&#x000A;Copyright 2009 by Textfyre Inc&#x000A;Designed by Ian Finley&#x000A;Written by Jon Ingold&#x000A;Game Engine (FyreVM) by Jesse McGrew&#x000A;Inform 7 Story Programming by Graeme Jefferis and Jon Ingold&#x000A;Custom Library Messages extension by David Fisher&#x000A;Testing by Jon Ingold, Ian Finley, Paul O'Brian,&#x000A;Eric Eve, and Peter Berman&#x000A;Special thanks to Graham Nelson and Emily Short&#x000A;for all of their hard work on Inform 7.&#x000A;All rights reserved&#x000A;&#x000A;Abbot's Quarters&#x000A;If I thought Abbots lived in luxury, then I was dead wrong. Even my attic's cozier than this. The Abbot's got no furniture at all, except a desk and a cot, and no decoration except for a bust of St. Newton. None of the axle-mounted, bevelled mobiles I was expecting. There's barely even any sunlight: one thin window to catch the sunrise, opposite the door to the hallway back west.&#x000A;&#x000A;St. Newton is staring at the Abbot's unpolished Grandfather clock with a severe frown.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

"Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good."

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge looks up as I enter. "Ah, young - young Whotsit!" he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. "Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good." He smiles, then looks back down to his studies, muttering.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge's finger shakes terribly as he traces the Holy Lines across the sheet.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room?

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

Not only have I disobeyed him, but I've done it twice. "I'm going to have your skin," he hisses into in my ear. "I'm going to use it as a cloak comes winter. Understand?" With that he drags me back off to my attic. This time, I can barely climb the stairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;A quick pause for breath and&#x2026; right then. I'm ready. I'm going to get out of the Abbey somehow, and warn the Archbishop. And I won't give up till I've got there!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair. The Cabinet of Relics next to it is open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing &#x2026; the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;I can escape back into the cool of the Hall to the west.

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room?

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing &#x2026; the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;I can escape back into the cool of the Hall to the west.

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;I can see a picture here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Not only have I disobeyed him, but I've done it twice. "I'm going to have your skin," he hisses into in my ear. "I'm going to use it as a cloak comes winter. Understand?" With that he drags me back off to my attic. This time, I can barely climb the stairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;A quick pause for breath and&#x2026; right then. I'm ready.

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall.

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair.

Even my attic's cosier than this. The Abbot's got no furniture at all, except a desk and a cot, and no decoration except for a bust of St. Newton. None of the axle-mounted bevelled mobiles I was expecting. There's barely even any sunlight: one thin window to catch the sun-rise, opposite the door to the hallway back west.&#x000A;&#x000A;St. Newton is staring at the Abbot's unpolished Grandfather clock with a severe frown.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder is on one side, to the west. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should get out of the Cathedral and talk to the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It must have taken weeks! The hall continues northeast into shadow, and southwest, towards the sunlight, the Yard and above all, the Archbishop.&#x000A;&#x000A;The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough.

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder is on one side, to the west. Lights moves in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should get out of the Cathedral and talk to the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall.

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall.

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after 3pm.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden.&#x000A;&#x000A;Drake's just off to the west, and he's coming this way!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says.

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

They say there are twelve different numbers that used to be the first twelve but now no-one is allowed to use them. I don't believe a word of it, of course.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge looks up as I enter. "Ah, young - young Whotsit!" he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. "Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good." He smiles, then looks back down to his studies, muttering.&#x000A;&#x000A;Drake's footsteps echo in from the southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing &#x2026; the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner is the only machine I'm allowed to use: the Tea Maker.

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Upper Hall&#x000A;The Great Hall of the Abbey is the biggest room I've seen in my life, running from this end all the way southwest (and it is all the way, I'm never allowed further) to the Great Doors and the Yard outside. If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder is on one side, to the west. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should get out of the Cathedral and talk to the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen. Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing &#x2026; the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner is the only machine I'm allowed to use: the Tea Maker. There's a jar of tea leaf beside it. In the bracket of the machine is a tea cup.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;I can escape back into the cool of the Hall to the west.

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge looks up as I enter. "Ah, young - young Whotsit!" he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. "Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good." He smiles, then looks back down to his studies, muttering.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner is the only machine I'm allowed to use: the Tea Maker.

I can just make out the Corridor of Contemplation to the east, and the wider archway to the Scriptorium to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;But more importantly, the great Entry - and exit - of the Abbey is to the southwest. And if I'm going to get out of here and talk to the Archbishop that's the only way to go.&#x000A;&#x000A;But maybe you're starting to see what kind of luck I have. Right there, in the Entry, is Calvin, working on a clock.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously.

If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder is on one side, to the west. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should get out of the Cathedral and talk to the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen. Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing &#x2026; the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;I can escape back into the cool of the Hall to the west. South, through a broad arch, is the Refectory.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after quarter past three.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden.&#x000A;&#x000A;Distantly - but not distantly enough - I can hear the clock and clatter of Drake's boots.

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The walls are carelessly lit by candles moving through Sacred Tracks suspended in the air. I can just make out the Corridor of Contemplation to the east, and the wider archway to the Scriptorium to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;But more importantly, the great Entry - and exit - of the Abbey is to the southwest. And if I'm going to get out of here and talk to the Archbishop that's the only way to go.&#x000A;&#x000A;But maybe you're starting to see what kind of luck I have.

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously.

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge looks up as I enter. "Ah, young - young Whotsit!" he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. "Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good."

"Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good."

    <result xml:space="preserve">Lower Hall&#x000A;Looking northeast, the Great Hall of the Abbey stretches away like the belly of some big beast, its bony roof held up by pillars like swallowed trees. The walls are carelessly lit by candles moving through Sacred Tracks suspended in the air. I can just make out the Corridor of Contemplation to the east, and the wider archway to the Scriptorium to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;But more importantly, the great Entry - and exit - of the Abbey is to the southwest. And if I'm going to get out of here and talk to the Archbishop that's the only way to go.&#x000A;&#x000A;But maybe you're starting to see what kind of luck I have. Right there, in the Entry, is Calvin, working on a clock.&#x000A;&#x000A;Drake's on patrol, and I can hear him heading this way, from the northeast.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Scriptorium&#x000A;The Scriptorium is where the Copying takes place, though it's hard to believe that Copying once meant a team of monks working with carved rubber stamps. It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair.

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall.

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall.

The walls are carelessly lit by candles moving through Sacred Tracks suspended in the air. I can just make out the Corridor of Contemplation to the east, and the wider archway to the Scriptorium to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;But more importantly, the great Entry - and exit - of the Abbey is to the southwest.

"It's got to look as good as if we did it!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake mutters.

"Mustn't sleep," I can hear him saying. "Time doesn't sleep. Sleep is our great weakness." &#x000A;&#x000A;The grandfather clock ticks off a minute with a stately thunk. Quickly, I make the sign of the winding gear.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[5] x blanket&#x000A;The Abbot's cot is a hard wooden pallet, with no pillow and one small blanket. "Mustn't sleep," I can hear him saying. "Time doesn't sleep. Sleep is our great weakness." &#x000A;&#x000A;From the hallway outside comes the echo of voices. Too shaky to be Calvin or Drake. More like - oh, no. It's the Abbot, coming back to his room. And if he finds me here, then my springs won't be worth the spindles they're sprung to...&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[6] x bust&#x000A;I can feel the well-fitted eyes of St. Newton gazing right down into my workings. Quickly, I make the sign of penduluum and look away. &#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot's voice is getting closer. The old man may move slower than a short hand, but he's definitely coming this way.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] x window&#x000A;The narrow-barred window catches the morning sunshine. The same sunshine that Drake and Calvin are out enjoying while I'm stuck in here. &#x000A;&#x000A;Oh, widdershins! Gubbler is right outside the door! I'd better hide somewhere!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] x door&#x000A;(the Abbot's Door)&#x000A;I see nothing special about the Abbot's Door.&#x000A;&#x000A;"We'll talk in here," I hear the Abbot saying, from right outside the door. "More private. More quiet. Much better." The old man steps inside the room, followed by a tall figure in grey. In the last tick before his old eyes can see me, I dive inside the gigantic clock case and pull closed the door.&#x000A;&#x000A;Inside Clock Case&#x000A;As the phrase goes, I'm stuck between a rack and a gear-trace; except here I'm in the narrow gap between the clock case door and the heavy swinging penduluum behind. And if that hit me, and disrupted the holy timings... well, there's no way they wouldn't notice when the clock-hands stopped moving, let's just say.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little light shines in through the keyhole, which is almost covered by the Abbot's spare robe.&#x000A;&#x000A;Oh, no... That click outside was the sound of the Abbot closing the door. Looks like he - and the grey figure I glimpsed with him - are going to be here for a while...&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] x pendulum&#x000A;The penduluum is a large amount of Holy Brass, properly blessed and bevelled. It swings back and forth, raising the weight of Precision against the counterweight of Slapdashery. &#x000A;&#x000A;"I told you now didn't I tell you?" old Abbot Gubbler is saying, plaintively. "Here? Why here? You shouldn't have come here."&#x000A;&#x000A;The Figure says something in reply. I can only hear two words, but they're enough to stop my heart. "Failure," and "Consequences."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] x weights&#x000A;I can't see any such thing.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] x weight of precision&#x000A;I only understood you as far as wanting to examine the penduluum.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] x counterweight&#x000A;The penduluum is a large amount of Holy Brass, properly blessed and bevelled. It swings back and forth, raising the weight of Precision against the counterweight of Slapdashery. &#x000A;&#x000A;"But these things, these things are not always tick-tock, they never are," the old man replies. His voice is quivering, quite different from the steady drone he has when intoning in Chapel. "The - item you asked about - it's in the Vaults, you see? The Vaults.

To the west, I can hear the gentle echo of ticks and tocks coming from the Abbey's main hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;Carved into the walls are a series of pious engravings, depicting the long path from initiate to Abbot.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] w&#x000A;I dart out of the tunnel only to be stop-clocked by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to stay there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again until I scurry out of reach up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;*** CHAPTER 2: No Place to Hide ***&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling...&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. Someone at the Cathedral would listen: I could tell the Archbishop himself, maybe. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] test abbey-garden&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] d&#x000A;I scramble quickly down the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Western Corner of the Great Hall&#x000A;I'm in the western corner of the Great Hall, just by the foot of the ladder up to my room (the rest of the hall is east). There's a note attached to the third rung asking Amble the caretaker not to put the ladder back in the garden just yet.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[17] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Upper Hall&#x000A;The Great Hall of the Abbey is the biggest room I've seen in my life, running from this end all the way southwest to the other end of the Hall (and it is all the way - I'm never allowed any further than the Great Doors and the Yard outside). If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder snakes down from one side, west of here. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should get out of the Cathedral and see the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[18] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Central Hall&#x000A;I'm standing in the very centre of the Abbey's Great Hall. It's impossible not to crane my neck at the ceiling held aloft by buttresses the size of gigantic oak trees. To think, people built this in the days before real pulley-transmissions! It must have taken weeks! The hall continues northeast into shadow, and southwest, towards the sunlight, the Yard and above all, the Archbishop.&#x000A;&#x000A;The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough. I can just make out archways both east and west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looking west, I can see Drake. He's coming this way! I'd better disappear northeast, southwest or east.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] e&#x000A;&#x000A;West Refectory&#x000A;I spend some of my time here, eating at one of the two long tables. I spend even more serving the monks. Each of them has their own seat, marked by a little brass hourglass, and if the twenty or so I can see here weren't enough (which they aren't), there's more to the east, where the Refectory continues. Back west is the archway to the Great Hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the table is a single empty teacup, left over from breakfast.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] get cup&#x000A;I pick up the empty cup from its place beside by Brother Horloge's hourglass.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looking west, I can see Drake. He's coming this way! Escape lies east.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[21] e&#x000A;&#x000A;East Refectory&#x000A;The eastern end of the long Refectory is given over in part to the tables lined with brass hourglasses, but in the other half there's nothing but the enormous Refectory Clock. It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after three o'clock.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden.&#x000A;&#x000A;Drake's coming! I can escape north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[22] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen. Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing ... the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat are almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf. &#x000A;&#x000A;The cool of the Hall is west. South, through a broad arch, is the Refectory. North is the dark recess of the Pantry.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looking south, I can see Drake. He's coming this way! Time to leave: I can go north or west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[23] put cup in bracket&#x000A;I put the teacup into the bracket.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[24] hide in pantry&#x000A;I duck into the pantry.&#x000A;&#x000A;Abbey Pantry&#x000A;The Pantry is as tiny as a clock-case and filled with shelves that smell of herb and oil - but it's dark enough to hide someone like me...&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[25] s&#x000A;Just in time, I see Drake's there. I hang back. He'll move on in a moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;I hear footsteps, moving away into the Abbey.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[26] s&#x000A;I'm distracted for a moment by a strong smell from one of the jars. It's only tea but it makes my stomach turn circles. How long till five o'clock and dinner time?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[27] smell&#x000A;The strongest smell comes from the jar of tea leaf on the shelves.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[28] take leaf&#x000A;I scoop up a handful of tea leaves.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[29] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen. Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing ... the list goes on.

South, through a broad arch, is the Refectory. North is the dark recess of the Pantry.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[30] put tea in basket&#x000A;The basket's now filled with tea leaves.&#x000A;&#x000A;The cook bustles past me, to wind the steamer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[31] x train&#x000A;I can't help but notice a worn down gear in the middle of the train, no longer catching teeth with its fellows. I make the sign of Sad Depreciation.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[32] get gear&#x000A;(the small gear)&#x000A;While the Cook is distracted - the Cook is always distracted - I pluck out the worn down gear. Not the sort of repair a clock polisher should be doing!&#x000A;&#x000A;The cook pushes past me, to tighten the grater.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[33] turn spigot&#x000A;The spigot releases a steady dribble of water into the kettle, filling it nicely. Across the room, the clouds coming from the steamer suddenly thin out.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Cook stops and gives me the most evil of evil stares. I turn the spigot closed again.&#x000A;&#x000A;The cook knocks past me, to unclip the steamer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[34] wind key&#x000A;(the tea maker key)&#x000A;A few turns and the spring is fully wound.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[35] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Upper Hall&#x000A;If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder snakes down from one side, west of here. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should head southwest out of the Cathedral and see the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[36] sw&#x000A;Just in time, I see Drake's there. I hang back. He'll move on in a moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The stones echo departing footsteps.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[37] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Central Hall&#x000A;I'm standing in the very centre of the Abbey's Great Hall. The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough. I can just make out archways both east and west.&#x000A;&#x000A;I hear footsteps, receding.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[38] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Lower Hall&#x000A;Looking northeast, the Great Hall of the Abbey stretches away like the belly of some big beast, laid out ready to have its mouth stuffed with an apple. The walls are lit in Holy Patterns by candles on Sacred Tracks suspended in the air. There's just enough light to make out the Corridor of Contemplation to the east and the wider archway to the Scriptorium to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;But more importantly, the great Entry - and exit - of the Abbey is to the southwest. And if I'm going to get out of here and talk to the Archbishop that's the only way to go.&#x000A;&#x000A;But maybe you're starting to see what kind of luck I have. Right there, in the Entry, is Calvin, working on a clock.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[39] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Scriptorium&#x000A;The Scriptorium is where the Copying takes place, though it's hard to believe that Copying once meant a team of monks working with carved rubber stamps. It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under it.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair. The Cabinet of Relics next to it is open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[40] get new gear&#x000A;"Put that back," Reloh snaps, without looking up. But I don't put it back.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[41] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Library&#x000A;The Abbey's library is small compared to the one in the Cathedral. There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge looks up as I enter. "Ah, young - young Whotsit!" he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. "Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good... of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good." He smiles, then looks back down to his studies, muttering.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[42] take keys&#x000A;Brother Horloge puts out a worn-out old hand. "Now don't you wander off with my keys," he says. "They're very important."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[43] e&#x000A;I catch the sound of hobnailed boots from that direction. Drake's heading this way. I'll wait and let him pass.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[44] e&#x000A;Just in time, I see Drake's there. I hang back. He'll move on in a moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge reaches up to pet his owl. The bird is motionless.&#x000A;&#x000A;Distantly - but not distantly enough - I can hear the Refectory Clock and clatter of Drake's boots. The sound's coming from the southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[45] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Central Hall&#x000A;I'm standing in the very centre of the Abbey's Great Hall.

The noise, smell and heat are almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf. &#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner is the only machine I'm allowed to use: the Tea Maker. In the bracket of the machine is a teacup. &#x000A;&#x000A;The cool of the Hall is west. South, through a broad arch, is the Refectory. North is the dark recess of the Pantry.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] put new gear in train&#x000A;I slip the new gear into place. The gear train forms a perfect snake from the lever, over the semi-circular bracket and into the innards of the machine.&#x000A;&#x000A;Drake's footsteps echo in from the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[50] pull lever&#x000A;Drake's just off to the south, and he's coming this way! Escape lies north or west.&#x000A;&#x000A;The gear train whirrs into life, swinging the kettle across inside the machine. Its base knocks open the gas-pipe tap. A jet of gas hisses out, blowing up a tiny sail attached by thread to the flint-iron. The burner is quickly alight.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[51] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Abbey Pantry&#x000A;The Pantry is as tiny as a clock-case and filled with shelves that smell of herb and oil - but it's dark enough to hide someone like me...&#x000A;&#x000A;The strongest smell in the room comes from a jar of tea leaf on the shelves.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[52] z&#x000A;Tick tock.&#x000A;&#x000A;I hear footsteps, receding.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[53] z&#x000A;The Universal Clock moves onwards: time happens.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[54] z&#x000A;Tick tock.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[55] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen.

The Cook turns and for the first time seems to notice me. He looks furious. "And where you thin' you go wi' tha'?" he demands. "Wait. Wa'."&#x000A;&#x000A;After a bit of tidying, he finds a button to press. A machine coughs and wheezes, and eventually a small half-slice of lemon squeezes from a slot. The Cook snatches it and drops it into my tea cup. "Ri' you are," he says, and then waves me away.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[57] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Upper Hall&#x000A;If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder snakes down from one side, west of here.

"It's the slight metallic tang that really gives it the whotsit," he adds. His eyes half-close in calm delight. "Now," he adds. "Was there anything?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[64] get keys&#x000A;His eyes are only half-closed. They're half-open as well. He bats my hand away firmly. "Leave them be," he says. Of course, he knocks them to the floor in the process and he doesn't notice that.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[65] get keys&#x000A;Very quietly, I pick the keys up off the ground.

If it weren't for the tall walls around the garden, I'd be in the street and running round to the Cathedral in a second's-swish!&#x000A;&#x000A;Abbey Herb Garden&#x000A;Standing in the garden is a bit like walking on tilting floorboards: every step you take has an unexpected spring to it. That's because where the ground should be there's a large metal disc with a large glass lens at its centre, on which all the soil beds are laid out like numbers on a clock. As the day goes on, the disc revolves so that the plants can follow the sunlight until at night, when disappear safely under the metal hood built into the south wall.&#x000A;&#x000A;Otherwise, there are tall walls on three sides and only one door, back into the Abbey, to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;The garden underfoot ticks slowly around.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[71] up&#x000A;Over the walls would get me round the side of the Abbey and straight to the Cathedral... but the walls are too smooth to climb and much too high to jump.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[72] w&#x000A;&#x000A;East Refectory&#x000A;The eastern end of the long Refectory is given over in part to the tables lined with brass hourglasses, but in the other half there's nothing but the enormous Refectory Clock. It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after five past three.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden. It's wide open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[73] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen. Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing ... the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat are almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf. &#x000A;&#x000A;The cool of the Hall is west. South, through a broad arch, is the Refectory. North is the dark recess of the Pantry.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[74] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Upper Hall&#x000A;If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder snakes down from one side, west of here. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should head southwest out of the Cathedral and see the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[75] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Western Corner of the Great Hall&#x000A;I'm in the western corner of the Great Hall, just by the foot of the ladder up to my room (the rest of the hall is east). There's a note attached to the third rung asking Amble the caretaker not to put the ladder back in the garden just yet.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[76] take ladder&#x000A;Taken. Might just do the trick, I think...&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[77] e&#x000A;I stumble along with the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Upper Hall&#x000A;If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room above the darkest corner of the hall, west of here. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should head southwest out of the Cathedral and see the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[78] sw&#x000A;If anyone catches me running around with this ladder, I'm dead.&#x000A;&#x000A;Central Hall&#x000A;I'm standing in the very centre of the Abbey's Great Hall. The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough. I can just make out archways both east and west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[79] e&#x000A;I troop onward with the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;West Refectory&#x000A;I spend some of my time here, eating at one of the two long tables. I spend even more serving the monks. Each of them has their own seat, marked by a little brass hourglass, and if the twenty or so I can see here weren't enough (which they aren't), there's more to the east, where the Refectory continues. Back west is the archway to the Great Hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[80] e&#x000A;&#x000A;East Refectory&#x000A;The eastern end of the long Refectory is given over in part to the tables lined with brass hourglasses, but in the other half there's nothing but the enormous Refectory Clock. It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after five past three.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden. It's wide open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[81] e&#x000A;I'm back in the garden. Just the walls between me and freedom!&#x000A;&#x000A;I slip the ladder awkwardly through the doorway.&#x000A;&#x000A;Abbey Herb Garden&#x000A;Right now, the lens in the centre of the great disc of the garden is bathed in light and the day-plants are out: basil, thyme, potatoes, other vegetables. The mushroom beds are under the metal hood on the south wall.&#x000A;&#x000A;Otherwise, there are tall walls on three sides and only one door, back into the Abbey, to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[82] put ladder against wall&#x000A;I lean the ladder up against the wall. It clears the top by a few feet.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[83] up&#x000A;In a flash, I'm up and over! It's a short fall to the alley behind the wall, then I scamper along a shadowy alleyway and out into the Cathedral Yard. I'm clear! Time to go see the Archbishop!&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;*** CHAPTER 3: In the Cathedral of Time ***&#x000A;&#x000A;Demo Room&#x000A;You have reached the end of the demonstration version for The Shadow in the Cathedral.

"It's got to look as good as if we did it!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake mutters. "Come on."&#x000A;&#x000A;Their voices disappear down the hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[3] w&#x000A;Curses to counterweights! It's not on my rota, this clock, so why should I finish off my polish on it? I head for the doorway - then freeze. Voices, coming down the hall. It's the Abbot Gubbler himself, coming this way!&#x000A;&#x000A;Remember, you can type "help" if you need assistance.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[4] hide in clock&#x000A;(first opening Gubbler's Grandfather clock)&#x000A;Remember, you can type "help" if you need assistance.&#x000A;&#x000A;"We'll talk in here," I hear the Abbot saying, from right outside the door. "More private. More quiet. Much better." The old man steps inside the room, followed by a tall figure in grey. In the last tick before his old eyes can see me, I dive inside the gigantic clock case and pull closed the door.&#x000A;&#x000A;Inside Clock Case&#x000A;As the phrase goes, I'm stuck between a rack and a gear-trace; except here I'm in the narrow gap between the clock case door and the heavy swinging penduluum behind. And if I get in the way of that, and disrupt the clock's holy timings... well, there's no way they wouldn't notice when the clock-hands stopped moving, let's just say.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little light shines in through the keyhole, which is almost covered by the Abbot's spare robe hanging inside the case.&#x000A;&#x000A;Oh, no... That click outside was the sound of the Abbot closing the door. Looks like he - and the grey figure I glimpsed with him - are going to be here for a while... And if they find me here, I'll be unwound!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[5] put tumbler on door&#x000A;Oh... well, then. I tip out the last of the polish onto the floor of the clock. At least that part will shine.&#x000A;&#x000A;I put the glass tumbler carefully against the door, then lean down to press my ear against it. Fantastic! I can hear much more clearly now!&#x000A;&#x000A;Remember, you can type "help" if you need assistance.&#x000A;&#x000A;"I told you now didn't I tell you?" old Abbot Gubbler is saying, plaintively. "Here? Why here? You shouldn't have come here."&#x000A;&#x000A;The Figure says something in reply. With the glass, I can hear quite clearly. That was a good idea. "We have been disappointed with your failure. The cause and effect principle, Abbot. Such failure must bring consequences."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[6] z&#x000A;Tick tock.&#x000A;&#x000A;The help system will now turn off its reminder, but you can always type "help" at any time.&#x000A;&#x000A;"But these things, these things are not always tick-tock, they never are," the old man replies. His voice is quivering, quite different from the steady drone he has when intoning in Chapel. "The - item you asked about - it's in the Vaults, you see? The Vaults. Even if I could get in, I ..."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Your excuses we find disappointing. Very disappointing. More of this and, Abbot, we may need to unslip your gears completely."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] z&#x000A;A few heartbeats measure a few seconds.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot is spluttering and choking. I've seen him like this only once, when as a young foundling I dropped and smashed an altimeter right before the Archbishop was due to visit.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Figure continues. "Clearly you're too old to steal the item for us. We have a better mechanism for obtaining it. But you must provide us with the opportunity. Is that understood?"&#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot nods violently, shaking out agreement the way I might beat dirt from a duster. "My money?" he asks.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] z&#x000A;The Universal Clock moves onwards: time happens.&#x000A;&#x000A;For a moment, there's nothing more. Then the Figure says, all too clearly: "You understand what you're doing? The Church will never recover from this."&#x000A;&#x000A;Maybe the Abbot replies: just a badly-oiled squeak.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] z&#x000A;Tick tock.&#x000A;&#x000A;There's the clink, of a pouch of golden minutes. A heavy pouch. The Figure, paying the Abbot...? Then suddenly, there's a third voice. "Sorry, Father, to interrupt, but you said..."&#x000A;&#x000A;It's a monk of the Abbey. "Get out!" the Abbot screeches. His bearing's lost its oil, it seems. "Get out, get out!"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] z&#x000A;A few heartbeats measure a few seconds.&#x000A;&#x000A;"But Father," the monk continues, "it's time, you know. You told me to tell you when it was time."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh! Of course of course," he mumbles. "I'll... We'll continue this discussion later, then," he says, to the Figure.&#x000A;&#x000A;"We certainly will," the Figure replies.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Abbot leaves, and that leaves me alone, inside this clock, with the stranger outside. He's coming nearer... I can hear his fingers on the door of the case! I must have nudged the penduluum, he must have seen the clock-hands quiver... but then, there's the swish of his cloak as he moves away, and the click as the door closes. Phew.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[11] out&#x000A;I spill gratefully out of the clock, gasping for breath as though I've been underwater. I've just been holding it in, of course. As for what I've heard - well, I probably shouldn't have, and the quicker I can get out of here, the better.&#x000A;&#x000A;Abbot's Quarters&#x000A;I need to get out of this place as fast as I can and without attracting any more attention. The door to the hallway is back west and as for polishing the Grandfather clock - well, forget it!&#x000A;&#x000A;St. Newton is staring at the Abbot's unpolished Grandfather clock with a severe frown.&#x000A;&#x000A;(I should probably explain: there are pendulums and penduluums. A weight on a string, that's a pendulum. Once it's put into a clock it is sanctified by the clockwork, it becomes a penduluum. Anyone can make or swing or polish a pendulum. Only the most holy can touch a penduluum.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[12] open door&#x000A;I haul open the door.&#x000A;&#x000A;I can't stop thinking about that Figure in Grey. Stealing from the Vaults... I always knew Gubbler was a rat, even if he is the Abbot! But whatever they're up to, I'm probably the only one who knows about it - which means I'm the only one who can stop it. Cog's Teeth! I might get made a novice for it! Even better, a 1st Assistant Clock Polisher - then I'd outrank Calvin and Drake!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[13] w&#x000A;I'm going to have to tell someone what I just heard. A theft, from the Vaults! But if the Abbot's involved - who else might be? After all, the figure he was talking to could have been anyone in the Abbey!&#x000A;&#x000A;Corridor of Contemplation&#x000A;The ancient stones of the Abbey rise to about shoulder-height before arching over, forcing me to bow my head in supplication before the Abbot's door, back east. To the west, I can hear the gentle echo of ticks and tocks coming from the Abbey's main hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;Carved into the walls are a series of pious engravings, depicting the long path from initiate to Abbot.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[14] w&#x000A;I dart out of the tunnel only to be stop-clocked by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to stay there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again until I scurry out of reach up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;*** CHAPTER 2: No Place to Hide ***&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling...&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. Someone at the Cathedral would listen: I could tell the Archbishop himself, maybe. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[15] test abbey-clock&#x000A;(Testing.)&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[16] d&#x000A;I scramble quickly down the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Western Corner of the Great Hall&#x000A;I'm in the western corner of the Great Hall, just by the foot of the ladder up to my room (the rest of the hall is east). There's a note attached to the third rung asking Amble the caretaker not to put the ladder back in the garden just yet.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[17] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Upper Hall&#x000A;The Great Hall of the Abbey is the biggest room I've seen in my life, running from this end all the way southwest to the other end of the Hall (and it is all the way - I'm never allowed any further than the Great Doors and the Yard outside). If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder snakes down from one side, west of here. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should get out of the Cathedral and see the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[18] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Central Hall&#x000A;I'm standing in the very centre of the Abbey's Great Hall. It's impossible not to crane my neck at the ceiling held aloft by buttresses the size of gigantic oak trees. To think, people built this in the days before real pulley-transmissions! It must have taken weeks! The hall continues northeast into shadow, and southwest, towards the sunlight, the Yard and above all, the Archbishop.&#x000A;&#x000A;The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough. I can just make out archways both east and west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looking west, I can see Drake. He's coming this way! I'd better disappear northeast, southwest or east.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[19] e&#x000A;&#x000A;West Refectory&#x000A;I spend some of my time here, eating at one of the two long tables. I spend even more serving the monks. Each of them has their own seat, marked by a little brass hourglass, and if the twenty or so I can see here weren't enough (which they aren't), there's more to the east, where the Refectory continues. Back west is the archway to the Great Hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the table is a single empty teacup, left over from breakfast.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[20] get cup&#x000A;I pick up the empty cup from its place beside by Brother Horloge's hourglass.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looking west, I can see Drake. He's coming this way! Escape lies east.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[21] e&#x000A;&#x000A;East Refectory&#x000A;The eastern end of the long Refectory is given over in part to the tables lined with brass hourglasses, but in the other half there's nothing but the enormous Refectory Clock. It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after three o'clock.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden.&#x000A;&#x000A;Drake's coming! I can escape north.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[22] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen. Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing ... the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat are almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf. &#x000A;&#x000A;The cool of the Hall is west. South, through a broad arch, is the Refectory. North is the dark recess of the Pantry.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looking south, I can see Drake. He's coming this way! Time to leave: I can go north or west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[23] put cup in bracket&#x000A;I put the teacup into the bracket.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[24] hide in pantry&#x000A;I duck into the pantry.&#x000A;&#x000A;Abbey Pantry&#x000A;The Pantry is as tiny as a clock-case and filled with shelves that smell of herb and oil - but it's dark enough to hide someone like me...&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[25] s&#x000A;Just in time, I see Drake's there. I hang back. He'll move on in a moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;I hear footsteps, moving away into the Abbey.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[26] s&#x000A;I'm distracted for a moment by a strong smell from one of the jars. It's only tea but it makes my stomach turn circles. How long till five o'clock and dinner time?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[27] smell&#x000A;The strongest smell comes from the jar of tea leaf on the shelves.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[28] take leaf&#x000A;I scoop up a handful of tea leaves.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[29] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen.

I make the sign of Sad Depreciation.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[32] get gear&#x000A;(the small gear)&#x000A;While the Cook is distracted - the Cook is always distracted - I pluck out the worn down gear. Not the sort of repair a clock polisher should be doing!&#x000A;&#x000A;The cook pushes past me, to tighten the grater.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[33] turn spigot&#x000A;The spigot releases a steady dribble of water into the kettle, filling it nicely. Across the room, the clouds coming from the steamer suddenly thin out.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Cook stops and gives me the most evil of evil stares. I turn the spigot closed again.&#x000A;&#x000A;The cook knocks past me, to unclip the steamer.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[34] wind key&#x000A;(the tea maker key)&#x000A;A few turns and the spring is fully wound.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[35] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Upper Hall&#x000A;If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder snakes down from one side, west of here. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should head southwest out of the Cathedral and see the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[36] sw&#x000A;Just in time, I see Drake's there. I hang back. He'll move on in a moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;The stones echo departing footsteps.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[37] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Central Hall&#x000A;I'm standing in the very centre of the Abbey's Great Hall. The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough. I can just make out archways both east and west.&#x000A;&#x000A;I hear footsteps, receding.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[38] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Lower Hall&#x000A;Looking northeast, the Great Hall of the Abbey stretches away like the belly of some big beast, laid out ready to have its mouth stuffed with an apple. The walls are lit in Holy Patterns by candles on Sacred Tracks suspended in the air. There's just enough light to make out the Corridor of Contemplation to the east and the wider archway to the Scriptorium to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;But more importantly, the great Entry - and exit - of the Abbey is to the southwest. And if I'm going to get out of here and talk to the Archbishop that's the only way to go.&#x000A;&#x000A;But maybe you're starting to see what kind of luck I have. Right there, in the Entry, is Calvin, working on a clock.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[39] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Scriptorium&#x000A;The Scriptorium is where the Copying takes place, though it's hard to believe that Copying once meant a team of monks working with carved rubber stamps. It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under it.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair. The Cabinet of Relics next to it is open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[40] get new gear&#x000A;"Put that back," Reloh snaps, without looking up. But I don't put it back.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[41] ne&#x000A;&#x000A;Library&#x000A;The Abbey's library is small compared to the one in the Cathedral. There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge looks up as I enter. "Ah, young - young Whotsit!" he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. "Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good... of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good." He smiles, then looks back down to his studies, muttering.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[42] take keys&#x000A;Brother Horloge puts out a worn-out old hand. "Now don't you wander off with my keys," he says. "They're very important."&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[43] e&#x000A;I catch the sound of hobnailed boots from that direction. Drake's heading this way. I'll wait and let him pass.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[44] e&#x000A;Just in time, I see Drake's there. I hang back. He'll move on in a moment.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge reaches up to pet his owl. The bird is motionless.&#x000A;&#x000A;Distantly - but not distantly enough - I can hear the Refectory Clock and clatter of Drake's boots. The sound's coming from the southwest.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[45] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Central Hall&#x000A;I'm standing in the very centre of the Abbey's Great Hall. The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough. I can just make out archways both east and west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Drake's footsteps echo in from the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[46] e&#x000A;&#x000A;West Refectory&#x000A;I spend some of my time here, eating at one of the two long tables. I spend even more serving the monks. Each of them has their own seat, marked by a little brass hourglass, and if the twenty or so I can see here weren't enough (which they aren't), there's more to the east, where the Refectory continues. Back west is the archway to the Great Hall.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[47] e&#x000A;&#x000A;East Refectory&#x000A;The eastern end of the long Refectory is given over in part to the tables lined with brass hourglasses, but in the other half there's nothing but the enormous Refectory Clock. It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after five past three.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[48] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen. Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing ... the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat are almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf. &#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner is the only machine I'm allowed to use: the Tea Maker. In the bracket of the machine is a teacup. &#x000A;&#x000A;The cool of the Hall is west. South, through a broad arch, is the Refectory. North is the dark recess of the Pantry.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[49] put new gear in train&#x000A;I slip the new gear into place. The gear train forms a perfect snake from the lever, over the semi-circular bracket and into the innards of the machine.&#x000A;&#x000A;Drake's footsteps echo in from the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[50] pull lever&#x000A;Drake's just off to the south, and he's coming this way! Escape lies north or west.&#x000A;&#x000A;The gear train whirrs into life, swinging the kettle across inside the machine. Its base knocks open the gas-pipe tap. A jet of gas hisses out, blowing up a tiny sail attached by thread to the flint-iron. The burner is quickly alight.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[51] n&#x000A;&#x000A;Abbey Pantry&#x000A;The Pantry is as tiny as a clock-case and filled with shelves that smell of herb and oil - but it's dark enough to hide someone like me...&#x000A;&#x000A;The strongest smell in the room comes from a jar of tea leaf on the shelves.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[52] z&#x000A;Tick tock.&#x000A;&#x000A;I hear footsteps, receding.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[53] z&#x000A;The Universal Clock moves onwards: time happens.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[54] s&#x000A;&#x000A;Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen.

North is the dark recess of the Pantry.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[55] take cup of tea&#x000A;I lift the cup carefully from the machine. The Cook turns and for the first time seems to notice me. He looks furious. "And where you thin' you go wi' tha'?" he demands. "Wait. Wa'."&#x000A;&#x000A;After a bit of tidying, he finds a button to press. A machine coughs and wheezes, and eventually a small half-slice of lemon squeezes from a slot. The Cook snatches it and drops it into my tea cup. "Ri' you are," he says, and then waves me away.&#x000A;&#x000A;I hear footsteps, receding.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[56] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Upper Hall&#x000A;If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder snakes down from one side, west of here. Lights move in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should head southwest out of the Cathedral and see the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;Footsteps - moving away.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[57] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Central Hall&#x000A;I'm standing in the very centre of the Abbey's Great Hall.

"Excellent, there," he says, beaming, nostrils twitching. "Such a smell! The finest!" He lifts the cup, takes a sip and smacks his lips. "It's the slight metallic tang that really gives it the whotsit," he adds. His eyes half-close in calm delight. "Now," he adds. "Was there anything?"&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[63] get keys&#x000A;His eyes are only half-closed. They're half-open as well. He bats my hand away firmly. "Leave them be," he says. Of course, he knocks them to the floor in the process and he doesn't notice that.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[64] get keys&#x000A;Very quietly, I pick the keys up off the ground. With his eyes half-shut, Horloge doesn't notice.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge is clearly enjoying his cup of tea.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[65] e&#x000A;&#x000A;Central Hall&#x000A;I'm standing in the very centre of the Abbey's Great Hall. The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough.

The Abbot has a whole sermon for it. So to do it, just like this, on a whim... I can feel in my stomach that it's not right, that if Clockwork is Clockwork then there must be a better way.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[71] set clock to 5 pm&#x000A;But the thought of that Figure in Grey spurs me on. So I make the sign of the Winding Key - maybe that'll buy me some forgiveness when I wind down - and then I push the hands around to five o'clock.&#x000A;&#x000A;The clash of metal on metal: the Refectory Clock leaps into life like an advancing army, with bells, gongs and organ pipes ringing and chiming and clanging away! Very, very quickly, I slam shut the clock case door and, covering my ears, rush over to the other side of the room. It's still horribly loud.&#x000A;&#x000A;The ringing of the Refectory Clock makes the very walls shake.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[72] w&#x000A;&#x000A;West Refectory&#x000A;The Hall is back west. In a few minutes, this room will be full of confused monks. I need to not be here when that happens...&#x000A;&#x000A;Calvin and Drake explode into the room and barge me out of the way as they race over to the East Refectory.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[73] w&#x000A;&#x000A;Central Hall&#x000A;The archway at the end of the hall, to the southwest, is clear. I can almost see the Cathedral beyond.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[74] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Lower Hall&#x000A;The exit to the Abbey is clear to the southwest. Quickly, now, before someone turns that clock off and starts looking for someone to blame!&#x000A;&#x000A;Gongs, bells and all manner of noises are echoing around the walls.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[75] sw&#x000A;&#x000A;Entry&#x000A;Sunlight and the sound of the city of St Philip pour in from the west through the Abbey's great doors. At last! I can get away and see the Archbishop!... before whatever happens, happens!&#x000A;&#x000A;To the east, a cloister runs towards the cells of the monks, novices, initiates, unaffiliated staff - really, of everyone apart from me.&#x000A;&#x000A;The stonework resounds with the sounds of gongs.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[76] w&#x000A;I race through the doors. No-one's going to stop me now! The Archbishop, and my reward - here I come!&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;*** CHAPTER 3: In the Cathedral of Time ***&#x000A;&#x000A;Demo Room&#x000A;You have reached the end of the demonstration version for The Shadow in the Cathedral.
