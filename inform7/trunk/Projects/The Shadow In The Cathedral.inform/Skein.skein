Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room?

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall.

"Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good."

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge looks up as I enter. "Ah, young - young Whotsit!" he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. "Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good." He smiles, then looks back down to his studies, muttering.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge's finger shakes terribly as he traces the Holy Lines across the sheet.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room?

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

Not only have I disobeyed him, but I've done it twice. "I'm going to have your skin," he hisses into in my ear. "I'm going to use it as a cloak comes winter. Understand?" With that he drags me back off to my attic. This time, I can barely climb the stairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;A quick pause for breath and&#x2026; right then. I'm ready. I'm going to get out of the Abbey somehow, and warn the Archbishop. And I won't give up till I've got there!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall.

    <result xml:space="preserve">East Refectory&#x000A;The eastern end of the long Refectory is given over in part to the tables lined with brass hourglasses, but in the other half there's nothing but the enormous Refectory Clock. It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after twelve o'clock.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden.&#x000A;&#x000A;I can see a garden door here.&#x000A;&#x000A;I've got a moment before Drake spots me: he's just appeared, to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

    <result xml:space="preserve">East Refectory&#x000A;The eastern end of the long Refectory is given over in part to the tables lined with brass hourglasses, but in the other half there's nothing but the enormous Refectory Clock. It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after quarter past three.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;I can see a picture here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Not only have I disobeyed him, but I've done it twice. "I'm going to have your skin," he hisses into in my ear. "I'm going to use it as a cloak comes winter. Understand?" With that he drags me back off to my attic. This time, I can barely climb the stairs.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;A quick pause for breath and&#x2026; right then. I'm ready. I'm going to get out of the Abbey somehow, and warn the Archbishop. And I won't give up till I've got there!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously.

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after 3pm.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden.&#x000A;&#x000A;Looking west, I can see Drake. He's coming this way!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair.

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's impossible not to crane my neck here, to gaze up at the ceiling held aloft by buttresses like gigantic oak trees. To think, people built this in the days before proper pulley-transmissions! It must have taken weeks! The hall continues northeast into shadow, and southwest, towards the sunlight, the Yard and above all, the Archbishop.&#x000A;&#x000A;The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough. I can just make out archways both east and west.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after twenty past four.&#x000A;&#x000A;Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north.

It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

If I crane my neck I can see the dark square of the floorboards of my room - the ladder is on one side, to the west. Lights moves in and out overhead, from the candles moving on their Holy Tracks. Strong smells float through an archway to the east.&#x000A;&#x000A;From their niches, the Three Major Saints are watching sternly, keen that I should get out of the Cathedral and talk to the Archbishop as quickly as possible.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen. Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing &#x2026; the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing &#x2026; the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;I've got a moment before Drake spots me: he's just appeared, to the south.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

And if that hit me, and disrupted the holy timings&#x2026; well, there's no way they wouldn't notice when the clock-hands stopped moving, let's just say.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little light shines in through the keyhole, which is almost covered by the Abbot's spare robe.&#x000A;&#x000A;Oh, no&#x2026; That click outside was the sound of the Abbot closing the door.

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room?

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room."

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds.

It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;I can see a pencil sketch here.&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says.

If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Kitchen&#x000A;If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen. Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing &#x2026; the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner is the only machine I'm allowed to use: the Tea Maker. There's a jar of tea leaf beside it. In the bracket of the machine is a tea cup.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;I can escape back into the cool of the Hall to the west. South, through a broad arch, is the Refectory.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge looks up as I enter. "Ah, young - young Whotsit!" he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. "Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good." He smiles, then looks back down to his studies, muttering.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's impossible not to crane my neck here, to gaze up at the ceiling held aloft by buttresses like gigantic oak trees. To think, people built this in the days before proper pulley-transmissions!

Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing &#x2026; the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat is almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf.&#x000A;&#x000A;In one corner is the only machine I'm allowed to use: the Tea Maker. There's a jar of tea leaf beside it. In the bracket of the machine is a steaming cup of tea. &#x000A;&#x000A;I can escape back into the cool of the Hall to the west.

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. On the floor by his feet is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;On the wheeled table is a cup of tea (in which is a slice of lemon).&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Then suddenly, there's a third voice. "Sorry, Father, to interrupt, but you said&#x2026;"&#x000A;&#x000A;It's a monk of the Abbey. "Get out!" the Abbot screeches. His bearing's lost its oil, it seems. "Get out, get out!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"But Father," the monk continues, "it's time, you know. You told me to tell you when it was time."&#x000A;&#x000A;"Oh!

He's coming nearer&#x2026; I can hear his fingers on the door of the case! I must have nudged the penduluum, he must have seen the clock-hands quiver&#x2026; but then, there's the swish of his cloak as he moves away, and the click as the door closes. Phew.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Even my attic's cosier than this. The Abbot's got no furniture at all, except a desk and a cot, and no decoration except for a bust of St. Newton. None of the axle-mounted bevelled mobiles I was expecting. There's barely even any sunlight: one thin window to catch the sun-rise, opposite the door to the hallway back west.&#x000A;&#x000A;St. Newton is staring at the Abbot's unpolished Grandfather clock with a severe frown.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">I dart of the tunnel, only to be stopped dead by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Their mouths are white with sugar.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Hey, you!" Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. "What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Yeah!" Calvin adds. "And why are you slipping away when we told you to be there?"&#x000A;&#x000A;"Idiot," Drake hisses. Louder - for the benefit of any passing monks - he says, "That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room." For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Up you go," Calvin says. "And you're not to come down till dark!"&#x000A;&#x000A;"What about dinner?" I ask.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?" Drake says.&#x000A;&#x000A;"More for us," Calvin adds. "Only two hours to go. I'm starved."&#x000A;&#x000A;With that, they punch me again, and wait until I scurry away up the ladder.&#x000A;&#x000A;Attic Room&#x000A;This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling&#x2026;.&#x000A;&#x000A;A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend).&#x000A;&#x000A;Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. The Abbot's about to do something terrible and I've got to stop him! Someone at the Cathedral would listen: the Archbishop himself, perhaps. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.&#x000A;&#x000A;But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. Clockwise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Lower Hall&#x000A;Looking northeast, the Great Hall of the Abbey stretches away like the belly of some big beast, its bony roof held up by pillars like swallowed trees. The walls are carelessly lit by candles moving through Sacred Tracks suspended in the air. I can just make out the Corridor of Contemplation to the east, and the wider archway to the Scriptorium to the west.&#x000A;&#x000A;But more importantly, the great Entry - and exit - of the Abbey is to the southwest. And if I'm going to get out of here and talk to the Archbishop that's the only way to go.&#x000A;&#x000A;But maybe you're starting to see what kind of luck I have. Right there, in the Entry, is Calvin, working on a clock.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair. The Cabinet of Relics next to it is open.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.&#x000A;&#x000A;Horloge looks up as I enter. "Ah, young - young Whotsit!" he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. "Look here!" he demands. "Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some - some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good&#x2026; of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good." He smiles, then looks back down to his studies, muttering.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under.&#x000A;&#x000A;Reloh works on one of the keyboards of the Duplicator, typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair.

There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them - he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.&#x000A;&#x000A;An archway leads east back into the hall.
