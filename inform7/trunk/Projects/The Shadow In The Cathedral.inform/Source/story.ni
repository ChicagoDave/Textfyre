When				Who		What
14-Nov-2009			J. Ingold	Missing ladder in Loading! Emily's bugs. (Except for one: removing rope from pipe, which I don't understand.)
1-Nov-2009			J. Ingold	Hints are in the game, tied to chapters for ease.
20-Oct-2009			J. Ingold	Most of PBerman's feedback
3-Oct-2009			J. Ingold	Eric's remaining feedback. 
2-Oct-2009			J. Ingold	Eric's feedback on C10.
27-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	Eric's feedback.
27-Sep-2009			j. ingold		Paul's #5. Fixed a few showstoppers. Some minor additions still outstanding, but I've got a list of them.
26-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	Eric's feedback.
26-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	Paul's feedback
25-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	Added chapter channel
24-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	More fixes
24-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	Nicer message for unlocking the garden door
24-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	More of Eric's feedback. 
22-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	More of Eric's feedback - missing responses and items.
22-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	Fix to Standard Rule bug to do with unlocking rules? Needs testing!!
21-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	Most of Eric Eve's feedback. Removed some items from the player when they crash through Covalt's ceiling to streamline the Crypt sequence and prevent complicated multiple solutions.
17-Sep-2009			J. Ingold 	I'm done!!
13-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	Added explanation of "penduluum" spelling (!). Finished off c10 with alternate solutions for the desk drawer. Begun looking at Chapter 11... Nearly there!!!
12-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	Clock workings, which were a bit of a mess... New substition, "one of", "once only", which prints once only (code change -> [once only] replaces where I've written [or][stopping]. If this breaks stuff, it can be easily Ctrl+H'd back!!
8-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	Started on C10. Synonyms for lighting a candle. In and out of locations. Touching the brazier. The secret passage.
8-Sep-2009			J. Ingold	 Finished C9 playthrough. A few additional responses, some more text for dishonest players (a reward!). 
6-Sep-2009			D. Cornelson	Fixed description.
2-Sep-2009              J. Ingold       Finished C8. A few rope tweaks, some synonyms for placing the ladder.
25-Aug-2009		J. Ingold	First pass at C8. Outside locations, synonyms and objects, in/out, jumping in water and swimming. Then I got stuck - apparently there's a wrench somewhere? This needs some cluing or something... (Oh, god, was I supposed to MOVE DEBRIS? C'mon...)
23-Aug-2009		J. Ingold	New kind - locative glimpse backdrop - these "localise" a location and auto- navigate towards it. I've populated the Abbey with some to ease the player around.
22-Aug-2009		J. Ingold	Finished c7 playthrough. Fleshed out chase sequence and Caught location. 
22-Aug-2009		J. Ingold	Added multiple solutions to the Difference Engine puzzle - if anything, I've been too generous!! Couple of other minors. Added board messages to room descriptions once they've been seen - code's a bit messy to ensure paragraph breaks are correct.
18-Aug-2009		J. Ingold	Started to play through Chapter 7. Fixed a bug(GJ, please check this!) in Textfyre Standard Rules for implicitly opening. [ Update: actually, GJ may have fixed this already? Anyway, it's gone. ]
17-Aug-2009 	J. Ingold	More of Paul's feedback, mostly missing responses. Changed TALK TO behaviour to use a prescripted list of topics (would be nice if the last of these was "What do you want to talk about?", and then hooked into the parser properly. But that might be pure sci-fi.)
14-Aug-2009 	J. Ingold	More of Paul's feedback and some left over from Eric's script. Started on Paul's new transcripts too.
10-Aug-2009 	J. Ingold	Some of Paul's feedback + some playtesting of C7.
5-Aug-2009	G. Jefferis	Final bug fixes from Eric
4-Aug-2009	G. Jefferis	Bug fixes from Eric - sh-v0.61-ECSE-01 (and various others)
3-Aug-2009	G. Jefferis	Bug fixes from Eric - sh-v0.61-ECSE-01
31-July-2009	J. Ingold	Added chapter breaks in proper places and a method for doing whatever it is we're going to do with them.
31-July-2009	J. Ingold	Added ian's c5 feedback.
25-July-2009 	J. Ingold	Resolved file, added some missing responses.
24-July-2009	J. Ingold	The majority of Eric Eve's two feedback scripts are dealt with. Remaining issues are one with TSR extension and some missing grammar (on my list to do!)
23-July-2009	G. Jefferis	Eric Eve bug fixes and a few others
22-July-2009	J. Ingold	c6 pass complete. Not entirely sure about the "difference" puzzle, really, but it'll do for now until we get some real playtesters. Some weirdness with random number fixing - Covalt's behaviour doesn't seem to be consistent?
20-July-2009	J. Ingold	Ian's C4 changes in. Added a few more routes through Covalt's Bedroom scene. Started on the Clock Shop rummaging scene.
14-July-2009	J. Ingold	Fixed test script.
13-July-2009 	J. Ingold		Added alternate solution to Chapter 2 - you can climb over the garden walls using the ladder to your bedroom. Needed a lot of extra stuff to let you carry the ladder around, have Drake take it back to position, etc. Also fixed the build (doh.)
12-July-2009	J. Ingold		Finished C5. Added roof objects. Lots of down/jump responses. Fixed descriptions of bridge/plank. Can remove tarp from chimney. Various tweaks to turning things forwards and backwards. Rewrote chapter ending text. 
11-July-2009 	J. Ingold		Added types of entering: is the player lying, sitting or clambering (or neither) - just for differentiating negative responses. Couple more Sa'at conversations. Added hymnals. Added hint to Lower Gears. Finished C4, mostly just adding scenery and jumping responses.
8-Jul-2009	G. Jefferis	Fight with Covalt
7-Jul-2009	G. Jefferis	Inner Vault and arrival of the figure
6-Jul-2009	G. Jefferis	Henge and Brass Head
6-July-2009	J. Ingold		Ian's C3 changes are almost all in. Added a new verb, "approaching" to cover "go to" and "follow" commands, and some (limited) support for these in the game. This will need a lot of new rules writing... Added a new kind, a "glimpse backdrop", which is a backdrop "too far away" to interact with, that can be identified (new relation) to a real game object. When approaching a glimpse, the game will take the player towards the identified item (if it has been identified with anything). Meanwhile, working through c4: the escaping Figure is a backdrop in all these rooms who you can "follow" and attempt (and fail) to talk to. fixed the penduluum sequence (counters go up after messages are printed, it seems, not before!)
3-July-2009	J. Ingold 	Added "talk" verb, and "ask about <topic>" with no specified NPC. Began C4.
2-July-2009	J. Ingold		Added Herb Garden location, where the player can (optionally) pick up a knife by solving a quick puzzle involving revolving flower beds. If they do, the knife & tome are removed from the Cyclical Library (in c3). Player's can't do both!
1-July-2009	J. Ingold		Last of Ian's C2 feedback. Indicated Horloge will talk after tea. Finished c3 playthrough. Added some missing descriptions, and a way to get the knife later if you missed it. Extended Sa'at conversation again.
30-Jun-2009 	J. Ingold		Player can now specify how many times to turn a crank/lever (a variable is set called "the number of turns to make") to speed up dial-setting puzzles. A general turn will pick a number at random, but tilt the random process to stop at correct positions for ease of use. Added some conversation to Sa'at. 
29-Jun-2009	J. Ingold		Additions to Doric and Sa'at. More conversation topics. Doric can be crashed into during chase scene, and he drops a hint. Orrery description changes on second viewing. Added "shout at" action. Added balcony rail to Clerestory. Added plural controls (cranks and dials) for catching non-specific input in the Library. In general, trooping my way through chapter 3, but not done yet. Also, most of Ian's changes to c2 incorporated (remaining to be added anon.)
24-Jun-2009	G. Jefferis	Gnomon control puzzle
23-Jun-2009	G. Jefferis	Crypt map and scenery
22-Jun-2009	G. Jefferis	Entry to Crypt
21-Jun-2009	J. Ingold		Added "Set clock to dinner-time"
21-Jun-2009	J. Ingold		Doric: added hints to his creed response. Made chase sequence give a hint about the creed. Pushed players to explore further. Fixed a bug with hiding.
20-Jun-2009	J. Ingold		Started playthrough of ch. 3. Added "Cathedral Space" region to cover the rooms. Added cathedral backdrop to these. Made "in" and "out" work. Added some hints after meeting Doric and to room descriptions. Added "listen" responses for the monks. Auto-exit of pews.
19-Jun-2009	J. Ingold		ch. 1 stuff: Fixed issues from Ian and David. Added "making to leave" action, covering EXIT and GO OUT, for diverting movement. Added short-cuts, extra turns to first scene. Fixed bug on typing "open clock" twice. Added Wren's description to the start text. Some rewrites to try and add tension. DIDN'T add ceiling/wall/floor objects - that's a bit scary. 
18-Jun-2009	D. Cornelson	Updated standard credits and added play-testing commenting code. Added first bits of regression response testing.
16 Jun 2009	J. Ingold		Added "hide" command (action is "hiding from view"), used to give a response to more general input. Fixed a bug in the tea-machine process. Repaired the abbey test script, that I seem to have broken by changing Drake's logic. Changed descriptions of the Hall rooms when the gongs are ringing and the player should be heading out.
16 Jun 2009	G. Jefferis	Return to Cathedral
15 Jun 2009	G. Jefferis	Return to Cathedral; Calvin's Patrol
15 Jun 2009	J. Ingold		Play-tested C2. Several changes, including a Pantry off the kitchen with tea leaves in and the ability to hide from Drake. Synonym "fill <x> with water".

09 Jun 2009	G. Jefferis	Autopothecary complete
05 Jun 2009	G. Jefferis	Autopothecary boxes
05 Jun 2009	J. Ingold		Better cluing for the 5pm time-setting. Horloge nows "walks through" to hint about the keys (so long as you haven't seen him before). Some text rewrites.
04 Jun 2009	J. Ingold		Added synonyms to verbs. Removed grammar lines leading to "rub" action. Added an ornamental action, "making the sign of". Slowed the clock-kind down to increase by 1 minute every 10 turns (to "discourage" accidental solution of time-puzzles -- it now takes 1200 moves for the Refectory Clock to strike 5pm, instead of only 120.) Added "[or-separated list of ...] substitution and used it to give help escaping Drake.

	change the face value of the timepiece to t;
	change the second-hand of the timepiece to 0;

The advance clocks rule is listed after the advance time rule in the turn sequence rules.

This is the advance clocks rule:
	repeat with timepiece running through clocks:
		let x be the face value of the timepiece;
		increase the second-hand of the timepiece by 1;
		if the second-hand of the timepiece > 10:

		decide on first wax; [first trivial case - e.g. red + red]
	if first wax is brown or second wax is brown:
		decide on brown; [second trivial case - e.g. brown + anything.]
	if first wax is secondary and second wax is secondary:

			decide on result entry;
		if first wax is wax2 entry and second wax is wax1 entry:
			decide on result entry;
	decide on brown;

Chapter 2 - Wax lumps

Wax lump is a kind of thing.
A wax lump has a wax color called the color.
A wax lump has a number called the size.

The indefinite article of a wax lump is usually "a". [We need to set a default value, because later in the game - as an easter egg - we change the article. If we don't specify a default, we can't do this.]

Understand the color property as describing a wax lump.

	move lump B to the Beehive;
	change the color of lump A to the new color;
	change the size of lump A to the new size;

Section 2 - mixing lumps together by hand

[ I'd like to add the following, but the syntax is messy to build: "Squeeze blue and red lumps together". What we need is a multiple action that's not treated as one. One for later, maybe? ]

[Instead of squeezing a wax lump (called lump A) into a wax lump (called lump B):
	say "I squish and squirm and squiff the two lumps together, ending up with ";
	melt together lump A and lump B;
	say "[a lump A]."

Instead of squeezing a wax lump into a candle:
	try squeezing the second noun into the noun.

Instead of squeezing a candle into a wax lump:
	say "I'd need to melt down [the noun] first somehow, it's not soft enough as [it-they] [is-are]."

Instead of squeezing a candle into a candle:

	try getting off the perch;
	if the player is not on a pew, continue the action;

Before exiting when the player is on a pew (called the perch):
	try getting off the perch instead.

Instead of entering a pew when the player is lying:
	say "This isn't the time to catch forty winks!"

Report entering  a pew:

Instead of taking a hymnal:
	say "I don't need one: I know all the hymns by gear."

Rule for printing the description of a hymnal:
	say "The hymnal is a small leather-bound prayer book printed on one of the Abbey duplicators. It lists all the words for the hymns. I don't know why, since most people in this city can't read, but I suppose it must make them feel better to know there [i]are[r] words."

Instead of searching, reading or opening a hymnal:
	say "I open the page to a random hymn: [i][one of]All Springs Bright and Beautiful[or]Onward, Machinist Solders[or]The Third Law is my Shepherd[or]Gracious Grease, Oil in Me[or]When a Knight Wound his Spurs[or]Let All the World Rejoin[or]Where Angels Fear to Thread[stopping][r]."

Instead of reading or opening a hymnal for at least the eighth time:
	say "Wren, come on. You can't waste all your time reading hymns, you've got to do something about that Figure!"

To say value of (C - a Cartesian Control):
	say "[tens part of coordinate of C][units part of coordinate of C]";

Rule for printing the description of a Cartesian Meter (called m):
	let mod be the model of m;
	say "A glass cylinder capped with steel and engraved with a letter [letter of mod]. Inside are two revolving tumblers engraved with numerals (reading [i][value of mod][r]). Two piston-arms lead back to the [metal of mod] crank.";

Understand "cylinder" as a Cartesian Meter.

Does the player mean doing something with a Cartesian Meter: it is unlikely.
[ we can't fix overeager disambiguation properly, there are too many verb permutations and the parser is highly dim when it comes to this issue. Hmph. ]  

Part 10 - Heavy Things

A thing can be heavy. A thing is usually not heavy.

Printing the take event of something is an activity.

Setting action variables for abacus-setting something to:
	now the model being adjusted is the controlled model of the noun;

Section 2 - Verification

Check setting an abacus to: [the second noun has been parsed as an object in scope!]
	say "The abacus can only handle 5 digit numbers." instead;

Check abacus-setting an abacus to:
	if the number understood is less than 10000 or the number understood is greater than 99999:
		say "The abacus has five rows exactly, one for each digit." instead;

Check abacus-setting an abacus to:
	if the number understood is the stored value of the model being adjusted:
		say "The abacus is already set to [number understood]." instead;

Check abacus-setting a locked abacus to:
	say "[one of]I try moving the beads on the abacus but they’re all firmly fixed in place. Surely an abacus where you can’t move the beads is as much use as a clock where you have to move the hands?[or]The gears on the abacus won’t move.[stopping]";
	provide key-hint;
	stop the action;

Check abacus-setting an abacus to:
	if the model being adjusted is correctly set:
		say "I’ve got this part as good as it’s going to get, I think." instead;

Check abacus-setting an abacus to:
	unless "[the number understood]" exactly matches the regular expression "<1-9>{5}",
		say "The abacus doesn't have a setting for zero." instead;

Section 3 - Implementation

Carry out abacus-setting an abacus to:
	update the model being adjusted to the number understood;

To update (dm - a difference-engine model) to (n - number):
	change the stored value of dm to n;
	change the stored meaning of dm to the meaning calculated by dm;

To decide which indexed text is the meaning calculated by (dm - a difference-engine model):
	[we do so arithmetically rather than by converting to indexed text]
	let the meaning be indexed text;
	let n be the stored value of dm;
	assert that n is at least 11111 and n is at most 99999 issuing "Difference engine value out of range.";
	repeat with i running from 1 to 5:
		let l be the remainder after dividing n by 10;
		[l is now the least significant digit of n]
		choose row l in the word-table of dm; 
		if i is:
			-- 1: let the meaning be "[p5 entry]";
			-- 2: let the meaning be "[p4 entry] [meaning]";
			-- 3: let the meaning be "[p3 entry] [meaning]";
			-- 4: let the meaning be "[p2 entry] [meaning]";
			-- 5: let the meaning be "[p1 entry] [meaning]";
		let n be n minus l;
		let n be n divided by 10; [ -- hence dropping the final digit from n]
	decide on the meaning; 



Section 4 - Report

The correctness appraisal rules are an object-based rulebook.

Report abacus-setting an abacus to:
	say "[one of]I set the gears carefully, one by one, trying not to snap any of the tiny teeth along the bars of the frame. It’s a bit like teasing a comb through knotted hair and I don’t get much practice at that. [or]I set the gears quickly and carefully. [stopping]With a clatter, the words on the signboard overhead change. Now they read '[stored meaning of the model being adjusted]'[paragraph break]";
	now the model being adjusted is phrase-viewed;
	consider the correctness appraisal rules for the model being adjusted;
	if the rule succeeded:
		now the model being adjusted is correctly set;

Part 13 - Great Seals

A Great Seal is a kind of thing. A Great Seal is scenery.

Understand "great", "seal" as a Great Seal.

	say "([The seal nearby])[command clarification break]";
	try examining the seal nearby;

part 14 - Glimpse backdrops

A glimpse backdrop is a kind of backdrop. The description of a glimpse backdrop is usually "I can't see [the item described] right now."

Section 1 - Glimpses identify real objects

Shidentification relates various glimpse backdrops to one thing (called the true representation). The verb to shidentify (he shidentifies, they shidentify, he shidentified, it is shidentified, he is shidentifying) implies the shidentification relation.

Definition: a glimpse backdrop is matched-up if there is something shidentified by it.

A glimpse backdrop is usually privately-named. 

Rule for printing the name of an matched-up glimpse backdrop (called the image):
	say "[true representation of the image]";

[Understand "[something related by identification]" as a glimpse backdrop.]

[The Refectory-Glimpse is a glimpse backdrop, in the Kitchen, identifying the East Refectory. Instead of smelling the Refectory-Glimpse: say "It doesn't smell anything like as much as the kitchen does."]

[ This doesn't work because "matched-up" tests for things not rooms.... ]

Section 2 -  Interaction

Instead of doing something when a glimpse backdrop (called the far-off thing) is physically involved and the action is physical:
	say "I can't reach [the far-off thing] from where I am."

Instead of smelling a glimpse backdrop (called the far-off thing):
	say "I can't smell [the far-off thing] from here."

Instead of listening to a glimpse backdrop (called the far-off thing):

Section 3 - Approaching

Instead of approaching an matched-up glimpse backdrop (called the far-off thing):
	let N be a random thing shidentified by the far-off thing;
	let N be the location of N;
	if N is a room:
		let the way be the best route from the location to N, using doors;

Definition: a locative glimpse backdrop is matched-to if there is a room localised by it.

Rule for printing the name of an matched-to locative glimpse backdrop (called the image):
	say "[true location of the image]";

Understand "[something related by localisation]" as a locative glimpse backdrop.

Instead of approaching or entering an matched-to locative glimpse backdrop (called the far-off thing):

	if the way is a direction, try going the way instead;
	continue the action;

Instead of examining a matched-to locative glimpse backdrop (called far-off thing):
	let the way be the best route from the location to the true location of the far-off thing, using doors;

Does the player mean approaching a locative glimpse backdrop:
	it is likely.


Part 15 - Brass rods on table

[ hardly worth a kind, but I've done it anyway .]

A brass rod is a kind of thing.  Understand "brass", "rod", "long", "pole", "metal" as the brass rod.

Instead of examining a brass rod: say "The rod runs the length of the table, and is punctuated by hourglasses at Holy Intervals along its length."

Instead of doing something when the brass rod is physically involved:
	say "The brass rod is fixed securely into the tabletop."

Part 16 - Floor Substitutes

[ not actually a kind, but has some rules associated so it's a bit like one. ]

The verb to be remembered by implies the reversed knowledge relation.

Definition: a thing is inspected:
	if someone remembers it, yes;
	no;

Definition: a thing is uninspected:
	if it is inspected, no;
	yes;

Last after printing the description of an uninspected clutter thing (called junk):
	now the player remembers the junk;

Chapter 4 - Mirror rooms

A mirror-room has a text called the first description.
A mirror-room has a text called the second description.

Section 3 - Implementation

Before printing the description of an unvisited mirror-room (called m): 
	if the reflection of m is unvisited:

	let the controlling room be the room entered;
	if the room entered is minor, change the controlling room to the reflection of the room entered;
	if the room entered is first seen:
		say the first description of the controlling room, paragraph break;
	otherwise:

	now the item is examined;
	if the partner of the item is unexamined:
		now the item is first seen;
		now the partner of the item is second seen;

Rule for printing the description of a mirror-thing (called the item):
	let x be the item;
	if the item is minor, change x to the partner of the item;
	if the item is first seen:
		say the first description of x, paragraph break;
	otherwise:
		say the second description of x, paragraph break;

Rule for printing the description of the player:

Chapter 2 - Wren's Possessions

A thing called my lucky clock key is privately-named, worn by the player. The description is "The one thing I've had all my life. It's been there, on a string around my neck, for as long as I can remember. I keep hoping that it's a last gift from my [i]true[r] family, and one day it'll open a treasure-chest or the door of one of the Great Houses.

Understand "old", "dirty", "polishing" as the rag.

A tumbler is a container, open, carried by the player. The description is "A small glass with all that's left of my daily wood polish ration. How I'm supposed to do all the rest of my chores after this I don't know, but Drake and Calvin didn't seem too worried about that."

Rule for printing the description of the Abbot's Quarters during the Introduction:
	say "If I thought Abbots lived in luxury, then I was dead wrong. Even my attic's cozier than this. The Abbot's got no furniture at all, except a desk and a cot, and no decoration except for a bust of St. Newton. None of the axle-mounted, bevelled mobiles I was expecting. There's barely even any sunlight: one thin window to catch the sunrise, opposite the door to the hallway back west.";

Rule for printing the description of the Abbot's Quarters when Clock Case has been hidden in during the Introduction:
	say "I need to get out of this place as fast as I can and without attracting any more attention. The door to the hallway is back west and as for polishing the Grandfather clock - well, forget it!";

The description is "No wonder Calvin and Drake didn't want to do this. Abbot Gubbler's Grandfather clock is enormous: the face is the size of a dinnerplate and the cabinet below is big enough to be a wardrobe. Even just polishing the doors will take half an hour. The whole thing might take all day."

Instead of attacking the Grandfather Clock:

If he finds me here now he'll have me declared unmechanistical and maybe even throw me out of the Abbey!";

Before cleaning the Grandfather Clock:

		say "(with [the rag])[command clarification break]";
		try polishing the noun with the rag instead;

Instead of going through the Abbot's Door when Voices have not been heard:

'We have been disappointed with your failure. The cause and effect principle, Abbot. Such failure must bring consequences.'[otherwise]The Figure says something in reply. I can only hear two words, but they're enough to stop my heart. 'Failure,' and 'Consequences.' I'm straining to hear more. Something awful is going on here, but what?[end if]"

CCASE4 is a scripted event. The display text is "'But these things, these things are not always tick-tock, they never are,' the old man replies. His voice is quivering, quite different from the steady drone he has when intoning in Chapel. 'The – item you asked about – it's in the Vaults, you see? The Vaults. Even if I could get in, I ...'[paragraph break][if the player is eavesdropping]'Your excuses we find disappointing. Very disappointing. More of this and, Abbot, we may need to unslip your gears completely.'[otherwise]I still can't hear anything properly! The Figure is too far from the keyhole and speaks too quietly. 'Disappointing,' he says; something else, then 'unslip your gears.'[end if]"

CCASE5 is a scripted event. The display text is "The Abbot is spluttering and choking. I've seen him like this only once, when as a young foundling I dropped and smashed an altimeter right before the Archbishop was due to visit.[paragraph break][if the player is eavesdropping]The Figure continues. 'Clearly you're too old to steal the item for us. We have a better mechanism for obtaining it. But you must provide us with the opportunity. Is that understood?'[otherwise]The Figure's quiet voice continues. I can make out; 'too old to steal', 'a better mechanism', 'the opportunity.'[end if][paragraph break]The Abbot nods violently, shaking out agreement the way I might beat dirt from a duster. 'My money?' he asks."

CCASE5B is a scripted event. The display text is "For a moment, there's nothing more. Then the Figure says, all too clearly: 'You understand what you're doing? The Church will never recover from this.'[paragraph break]Maybe the Abbot replies: just a badly-oiled squeak."

CCASE6 is a scripted event. The display text is "There's the clink, of a pouch of golden minutes. A heavy pouch. The Figure, paying the Abbot...? Then suddenly, there's a third voice. 'Sorry, Father, to interrupt, but you said...'[paragraph break]It's a monk of the Abbey. 'Get out!' the Abbot screeches. His bearing's lost its oil, it seems. 'Get out, get out!'";

CCASE6B is a scripted event. The display text is "'But Father,' the monk continues, 'it's [i]time[r], you know. You told me to tell you when it was [i]time[r].'[paragraph break]'Oh! Of course of course,' he mumbles. 'I'll...

He's coming nearer... I can hear his fingers on the door of the case! I must have nudged the [i][penduluum][r], he must have seen the clock-hands quiver... but then, there's the swish of his cloak as he moves away, and the click as the door closes. Phew."

To decide if the clock event is finished:
	if CCASE6B is fired, yes;

Section 3 - After the clock scene

Heading for the Cathedral is a scene. Heading for the Cathedral begins when the location is the Abbot's Quarters and the Abbot's Door is open and the Inside Clock Case has been visited. Heading for the Cathedral ends when the location is the Cathedral Yard.

When Heading for the Cathedral begins:
	say "I can't stop thinking about that Figure in Grey. Stealing from the Vaults... I always knew Gubbler was a rat, even if he [i]is[r] the Abbot! But whatever they're up to, I'm probably the only one who knows about it - which means I'm the only one who can stop it. Cog's Teeth! I might get made a novice for it! Even better, a 1st Assistant Clock Polisher - then I'd outrank Calvin and Drake!"

A thing can be Drake-hideable. A thing is seldom Drake-hideable.

Part 1 - Corridor of Contemplation

Before making to leave in the Corridor of Contemplation: try going west instead.

Chapter 1 - Description

The Corridor of Contemplation is a room. "The ancient stones of the Abbey rise to about shoulder-height before arching over, forcing me to bow my head in supplication before the Abbot's door, back east. To the west, I can hear the gentle echo of ticks and tocks coming from the Abbey's main hall.[paragraph break]Carved into the walls are a series of pious engravings, depicting the long path from initiate to Abbot."

Check listening to the Corridor of Contemplation: 
	say "Ticks and tocks to the west that all say one thing. Hurry up!" instead.

Section 1 - Engravings

Some engravings are scenery, in the corridor of contemplation. "The carvings start with a young child, polishing and smoothing brass under the eye of some old monk. I don't remember them ever smiling at me that nicely. Then a bit along and further up than I am there are older children at the benches, placing cogs onto spindles. Then there's a long period of study, learning the Twelve Devotions of the Greater Rotation; then the monk's habit, the clock-face hair-cut and hours spent doing incision with the stylus... And beyond that takes me closer to the Abbot's door than I'd like. I don't want him to think I'm eavesdropping, do I?"

Understand "pious", "path", "initiate", "Abbot" as the engravings.

Rule for printing the description of the engravings during Introduction:
	say "If someone comes, that's what I'll do, to explain why I'm here. But no-one's coming, and that means I'd better get away, fast.";

Instead of doing something when the engravings are physically involved:

Chapter 2 - Exits

Instead of going west from the Corridor of Contemplation during Introduction:
	carry out the firing activity with ATTIC1;

ATTIC1 is a scripted event. 

Rule for firing ATTIC1 when Attic Room is unvisited:
	say "I dart out of the tunnel only to be stop-clocked by a depressing sight. It's Calvin and Drake, hurrying in through the Abbey's Great Entry. Their mouths are white with sugar.[paragraph break]'Hey, you!' Drake shouts. In a moment he's got me by the ear. 'What were you doing in the Abbot's room? That's not on your rota!'[paragraph break]'Yeah!' Calvin adds. 'And why are you slipping away when we told you to stay there?'[paragraph break]'Idiot,' Drake hisses. Louder – for the benefit of any passing monks – he says, 'That's it, Wren. You're consigned to your room.' For good measure, he punches me on the arm, then the two of them drag me away, heels over flagstones, right to the bottom of the ladder.[paragraph break]'Up you go,' Calvin says. 'And you're not to come down till dark!'[paragraph break]'What about dinner?' I ask.[paragraph break]'Should have thought of that, shouldn't you?' Drake says.[paragraph break]'More for us,' Calvin adds. 'Only two hours to go. I'm starved.'[paragraph break]With that, they punch me again until I scurry out of reach up the ladder.";
	end the chapter;

Rule for firing ATTIC1 when the caretaker's ladder is carried by the player:
	say "[one of]'Wren!' Drake exclaims. 'Where are you going with that? Think I can't send you back to your room without it, do you?' [or]'Wren!' Drake's face is boiling. 'I can't believe you've tried to steal that again? Turn it into firewood, would you?' He spells out the last few words with punches. [or]'I should take that ladder away while you're up there!' Drake exclaims, in irritation. [stopping]Then he [if the location is not the Rickety Stair][one of]marches[or]hauls[at random] me back to the corner of the hall, [end if][one of]props up[or]puts down[at random] the ladder, and [one of]punches[or]whallops[or]whackes[at random] [one of]me[or]my arm[at random] [one of]till I climb it[or]until I climb[at random].";
	move the caretaker's ladder to the Rickety Stair;

Rule for firing ATTIC1 when the caretaker's ladder is carried by Drake:
	say "'There you are!' Drake exclaims. He's carrying my ladder. 'I don't know how you got down without this, but [i]both[r] of you are going back!' With that, he [if the location is not the Rickety Stair] marches me to the corner of the hall,[end if] props up the ladder, and punches me till I climb back up.";
	move the caretaker's ladder to the Rickety Stair;



Rule for firing ATTIC1:
	say "[one of]'Wren!' Drake exclaims. He wallops me on the arm. 'I thought I told you to stay in your room?' He doesn't wait for an excuse before I'm dragged off to the ladder. Then he waits – and wallops me – until I give in and climb all the way back up.[or]Drake looks like he's swallowed a bee. Not only have I disobeyed him, but I've done it [i]twice[r]. 'I'm going to have your skin,' he hisses into in my ear. 'I'm going to use it as a cloak come winter. Understand?' With that he drags me back off to my attic. This time, I can barely climb the stairs.[or]Oh, no, not again... Drake storms in and grabs me by the nose. I'm pulled off to the ladder base. 'Please,' I beg. 'I'm too tired to climb it again.' He looks at me as if I'm stupid. 'Then don't climb back down this time!' he says.[or][final attic trip][stopping]";


To say final attic trip:
	say "Drake [one of]wallops[or]punches[or]hits[or]kicks[at random] me, [one of]boiling[or]shaking[or]simmering[at random] with [one of]rage[or]anger[or]fury[or]irritation[at random]. Back to the ladder, and up I go...";

After firing ATTIC1:
	move the player to Attic Room;
	say "[one of]Through my window I can see the Cathedral across the yard outside. If I was a bird, I could escape easily, and tell someone what I've overheard. Someone at the Cathedral would listen: I could tell the Archbishop himself, maybe. He might remember me from the time he visited, when he helped me repair an altimeter I'd broken. If only I could fly.[paragraph break]But perhaps I can escape on foot. If I'm clever. [i]Clockwise[r].[or]That was careless, getting caught. But I can still make it to the Cathedral. I'll just have to be more cunning this time. Remember, Wren, it's easy: the whole world runs on clockwork. Just a matter of staying ahead of the biting teeth.[or]A quick pause for breath and... right then. I'm ready. I'm going to get out of the Abbey somehow, and warn the Archbishop. And I won't give up till I've got there![stopping]"

To decide if the player is taken to the attic:
	if ATTIC1 is fired, yes;
	no;

To decide if the player is not taken to the attic:
	if the player is taken to the attic, no;
	yes;

The Cathedral is still just as far away, visible through the hole in the ceiling above my cot. But the ladder's the only way out of here.[otherwise]This isn't really an attic. It isn't really a room either. It's a couple of floorboards laid across some roof rafters right in the ceiling of the Abbey. There's enough floor-space for a cot and a laundry crate, but I have to be careful not to roll out of bed, because if I do, the thick cobwebs all around aren't going to stop me from falling...[paragraph break]A little hole in the ceiling provides some sunlight: and when it rains, it means I can wash my hair, too. It's right above the rickety ladder down to the ground (and that means the ladder is starting to rot and bend)."

'You'd better not grow,' Drake's told me before. 'Or you'll go straight through yourself.'[paragraph break]Beside the cot is a pencil sketch of my family." Understand "pine", "pinewood", "bedframe", "frame", "wood", "wooden", "bed" as my cot.

Instead of entering my cot:

"[if Gong Sounding is not happening]If there was ever a proof of the perfection of Clockwork over Nature, it's that the dirtiest and most hectic room in the whole Abbey is its Kitchen. Shelves, walls and floor are covered by machines belching, slicing, steaming, chopping, stirring, boiling, broiling, frying, pureeing ... the list goes on. The noise, smell and heat are almost overpowering, and the Cook, who controls this madhouse, can only stand it because he's stone deaf. [otherwise]The Cook is working like a double-escapement all of a sudden, probably trying to get dinner ready two hours too soon! [end if][if Quest for Tea is happening][paragraph break][tea machine details][end if][paragraph break]The cool of the Hall is west. South, through a broad arch, is the Refectory[if Gong Sounding is happening], where the Refectory Clock is throwing up a wall of sound[end if]. North is the dark recess of the Pantry."

To say tea machine details:
	say "In one corner is the only machine I'm allowed to use: the Tea Maker. [if the bracket contains the empty teacup]In the bracket of the machine is a teacup. [otherwise if the bracket contains the full teacup]In the bracket of the machine is a steaming cup of tea. [end if]";

Chapter 2 - The Cook

Section 1 - Description

The Cook is a man, scenery, in the Kitchen. "[if Gong Sounding is not happening]The story goes that the Cook lost his hearing while setting rat-traps inside the great Refectory Clock. He'd been late about his chores and so instead of being there at 4.30 like his rota told him to, he was there at 5.00. When the gongs rang for dinner, he was still inside the case. If it's true, then never mind his ears, it's a wonder he can still [i]see[r] or [i]think[r]. That clock is [i]seriously[r] loud.[otherwise]The Cook has gone into double-time.[end if]"

Rule for speaking with the cook:
	say "The Cook doesn't waste time trying to lip-read. He picks me up, puts me to one side, and gets back to [one of]walloping the toaster[or]scooping soot from the grill[or]injecting steam through a waxed cloth pipe into a pot[or]cooking[or]plugging holes in a hot-water pipe with bread dough[or]setting dials on the furnaces[or]stirring a pan using a three-foot spoon[at random]." instead.

Section 4 - Tea making script

TEA1 is a scripted event. The display text is "The gear train whirrs into life, swinging the kettle across inside the machine. Its base knocks open the gas-pipe tap. A jet of gas hisses out, blowing up a tiny sail attached by thread to the flint-iron. The burner is quickly alight."

After firing TEA1:
	now the tea-machine is switched on;
	now the burner is lit;

TEA2 is a scripted event. The display text is "After a minute or so, steam begins to rise from the kettle. This steam collects on a fine gauze over the kettle, which slowly weighs down on a thin metal strut. Eventually, the pressure is enough to flip a counterweight, and the gauze tilts, pushes the kettle onto its side. Boiling water pours from the spout and into the basket of tea leaves. As the kettle empties, its weight shifts and it swings back. A pin on one side knocks closed the gas pipe."

After firing TEA2:
	now the kettle is empty;
	now the burner is unlit;

TEA3 is a scripted event. The display text is "The basket on the tea-maker slowly filters tea into the waiting cup. Meanwhile, the slowing gears move the kettle back to its original position below the spigot, and the water on the gauze sheet evaporates away. All is restored: 'Every cog comes full circle,' as they say."

After firing TEA3:
	do nothing;

TEA4 is a scripted event. The display text is "The lever springs back. The tea is finished. In a final convulsion, the machine spits the used tea leaves out the back and into a composter duct, ready to be fed to the cows that provided the gas... It's certainly neat."

After firing TEA4:
	now the basket is empty;
	now the teacup is full;
	now the tea-machine is switched off;

Part 6 - Library

Chapter 1 - Description

The Library is a room. "The Abbey's library is small compared to the one in the Cathedral. There's nothing on the shelves but the key texts: the Principia, the Mechanistica and the Determininium. Only Brother Horloge, the Abbey's Primary Reader ever seems to use them – he's here at the moment, studying at his desk by the poor light coming through the stained glass windows. [if Horloge's keys are on the wheeled table]By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys. [otherwise if Horloge's keys are in the location]On the floor by his feet is a fat bunch of keys. [end if]On his shoulder is his mechanical owl, wings folded.[paragraph break]An archway leads east back into the hall. From the southwest comes the clatter of Writing hammers and the sharp smell of burnt ink.[if Gong Sounding is happening][paragraph break]Brother Horloge doesn't seem to notice the ringing gongs. He's too engrossed in the smells from his teacup.[end if]"

Chapter 2 - Scenery

Section 1 - Shelves

Some shelves are scenery, in the Library. "The shelves have a lean to them because the [i]Determininium[r] by St Babbage is such a weightier tome than the [i]Principia[r] of St Newton. 'Truly blessed are the smaller and most intricate,' as they say."

Understand "shelf", "shelving" as the shelves.

Instead of putting something on the shelves:
	say "The shelves are only for the holiest of texts.";

Instead of climbing the shelves:
	say "They'd collapse in a moment.";

Section 2 - Books

Some books are scenery, in the Library. "Old leather bound tomes."

Understand "leather", "bound", "tomes", "holy", "texts", "determinium", "principia", "mechanistica", "leather-bound" as the books.

Instead of taking the books:
	say "[one of]A 2nd Assistant Clock Polisher isn't even allowed to dust the Holy Texts. Besides, I only read Latin and these books are all in Mathematik.[or]Really, these books are in Mathematik. I barely speak my own language.[or]I can't read these books! They're all Holy Gibberish![stopping]";

Instead of reading the books:
	try taking the books;

Instead of researching when in the Library:
	try taking the books.

Instead of consulting the books about when in the Library:
	try taking the books.

Instead of smelling the books:
	say "They smell of dust and damp and animal skin."

Section 3 - Stained Glass Window

The library astrolabe window is a stained glass window, scenery, in the Library. "The glass panels are stained to depict a watch escapement, an astrolabe and below them both, the wide-spread arms of a beatific orrery. Not much light gets through them at all."

Understand "windows", "panels", "panel", "watch", "escapement", "astrolabe", "orrery" as the library astrolabe window.

Section 4 - Table

A wheeled table is fixed in place, Drake-hideable, in the Library. The description is "The table is set on little brass castors to allow Brother Horloge to follow the feeble patch of sunlight around the room."

Understand "castor", "caster", "castors", "casters", "wheel", "wheels" as the wheeled table.

Rule for writing a paragraph about the wheeled table:
	[we suppress any "on the wheeled table is..." style messages:]
	now the wheeled table is mentioned;

Section 5 - Manuscript

A manuscript is scenery, in the Library. "Horloge is poring over a complex diagram, depicting the inner works of a [i]fusee[r]."
Understand "fusee", "diagram", "complex diagram" as the manuscript.

Instead of taking the manuscript:
	say "Brother Horloge is busy with it.";

Chapter 3 - Horloge

Section 1 - Description

Horloge is a monk, scenery, in the Library. "Horloge's eyes are screwed up behind the most complicated pair of spectacles I've ever encountered. They make it hard to even see his eyes – or rather what's left of them. He's read in the darkness here in the Library for so long he's basically blind. On his shoulder sits his pet owl. Same as Brother Horloge it looks more fearsome than it actually is.[if Horloge's keys are on the wheeled table][paragraph break]By his elbow is a fat bunch of keys.[otherwise if Horloge's keys are in the location][paragraph break]On the floor by his feet is a fat bunch of keys.[end if][paragraph break][if Horloge is sipping his tea]He's sipping his tea, quite content, eyes half-closed.[otherwise]He's poring over a page of manuscript, muttering quietly to himself.[end if]"

Horloge's spectacles are carried by Horloge. The description is "Horloge was probably born wearing spectacles. They're made of bottle-glass, ground to the right thickness.  'Spectacles are either expensive,' as he's told me, 'or simply not very good.'"

Before doing something when Horloge's spectacles are physically involved:
	say "I'd better leave them be[one of]. He's blind without them[once only]."

Understand "glasses", "bottle glass", "bottle-glass", "lenses" as Horloge's spectacles.

Section 2 - Idle Actions

The HorlogeCounter is a counter. The top end is 4. The internal value is 2. [We have the 'quest for tea' event on the first turn we enter.]

Every turn when the player can see Horloge:
	increment the HorlogeCounter;

Rule for firing the HorlogeCounter:
	say "[if Horloge is not sipping his tea][one of]Brother Horloge mumbles as he traces over the sheet of manuscript.[or]The sun shifts a little, and the Brother nudges the table to follow the pool of light.[or]Horloge's finger shakes terribly as he traces the Holy Lines across the sheet.[or]Horloge reaches up to pet his owl. The bird is motionless.[or]Horloge chucks his pet owl under its beak. There is no reaction.[at random][otherwise][one of]Brother Horloge leans back in his chair and sips his tea with eyes closed.[or]Horloge is clearly enjoying his cup of tea.[or]Horloge reaches up to stroke his owl. The bird is motionless.[at random][end if]";

Section 2b - Asking for

[ In future though, we might consider removing the "asking it for" action altogether, and have instead:
	[ Understand "ask [someone] for [text]" as asking it about. ]

...And dealing with whatever (hopefully lesser) problems that brings. ]

Instead of asking Horloge for Horloge's keys:
	if the player has Horloge's keys:
		say "I don't need to!";
	else:
		try taking Horloge's keys.

Instead of asking Horloge for the mechanical owl:
	say "He'd never give me his owl. It'd be like giving me his lungs, or one of his arms."

Instead of asking Horloge to try turning or switching on the mechanical owl:
	say "I think the Brother knows how to wind a clockwork. He doesn't need [i]me[r] to tell him."

Section 3 - Conversation

TRIG_WHOTSIT is a trigger.

Rule for firing unfired TRIG_WHOTSIT:
	say "I open my mouth to speak.[paragraph break]'Look here, Whotsit,' he interrupts. 'I've been at these books all day. Grappling with the Mysteries of the Whotsit. A cup of whotsit, that's all I want.'[paragraph break]";

Rule for speaking with Horloge when TRIG_WHOTSIT is unfired during the Quest For Tea:
	fire TRIG_WHOTSIT;

After speaking with Horloge when Horloge's keys are on the wheeled table:
	move Horloge's keys to the location;
	say "[one of]He's so enthusiastic as he talks that he knocks his keys onto the floor, though he doesn't seem to notice.[or]He knocks his keys back onto the floor.[or]He knocks his keys onto the floor again.[stopping]";

The conversation table of Horloge is the Table of Horloge's Conversation.

Just a cup of... a cup of... you know. Yes.'[or]'What kind of scullery maid are you?' he interrupts. Blinder than I thought, clearly. Any monk should know a 2nd Assistant Polisher when they see one.[or]'A cup of whotsit, whotsit,' he insists. 'And don't spare the horses.'[stopping]"

Section 4 - Owl

Horloge's mechanical owl is carried by Horloge. The description is "Horloge's mechanical owl sits on his shoulder. It seems to be asleep, its spring unwound." The printed name is "Horloge's mechanical owl". Understand "rachael", "spring" as the mechanical owl.

Instead of turning Horloge's mechanical owl:

CT_HOR2_FIGURE is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'What do you know about a Figure in Grey?' I ask.". The response text is "'Grey?' he asks. 'I don't know Grey. Now St. Newton and St. Breguet, they drew excellent figures. Absolute perfection.'"

Chapter 4 - Horloge's keys

Horloge's keys are a plural-named thing, on the wheeled table. The description is "A thick bunch of keys, to most of the Abbey's locks and clocks alike."

Horloge's keys unlock the Refectory Clock.

Understand "keyring", "key" as a Horloge's keys.

Instead of taking Horloge's keys when Horloge's keys are on the wheeled table:
	if Horloge is not sipping his tea:
		say "Brother Horloge puts out a worn-out old hand. 'Now don't you wander off with my keys,' he says. 'They're very important.'" instead;
	otherwise:
		move Horloge's keys to the location;		
		say "His eyes are only half-closed. They're half-open as well. He bats my hand away firmly. 'Leave them be,' he says. Of course, he knocks them to the floor in the process and he doesn't notice [i]that[r].";

Instead of taking Horloge's keys when Horloge's keys are in the Library and Horloge is not sipping his tea:
	now Horloge's keys are on the wheeled table;
	say "[one of]I wait for old Horloge to lose himself in his manuscript and then snaffle the keys from the ground. But he notices me, of course. 'Thank-you, young Whotsit,' he says. 'Just put them down on the table, there's a whotsit.' I do as I'm told.[or]Just as before: he sees me pick the keys up, and takes them back.[stopping]";

After taking Horloge's keys when in the Library:
	say "Very quietly, I pick the keys up off the ground. With his eyes half-shut, Horloge doesn't notice."

Chapter 5 - Event on Entering - Quest for Tea Scene 

The Quest for Tea is a scene. The Quest for Tea begins when the location is the Library.

When the Quest for Tea begins:
	say "Horloge looks up as I enter. 'Ah, young – young Whotsit!' he bellows, pointing a fat finger in my general direction, though through his thick multi-lensed spectacles I don't think he can quite see where I am. 'Look here!' he demands. 'Young Whotsit-whoever-you-are! I need some – some of that, you know. Some of that whotsit. A good... of whotsit? Uh-huh? Good? Good.' He smiles, then looks back down to his studies, muttering."

The Quest for Tea ends when Horloge is sipping his tea.

When the Quest For Tea ends:
	change the default topic of Horloge to CT_HOR2_DEFAULT;
	change the conversation table of Horloge to the table of Horloge's Further Conversation;

Instead of giving the handful of tea leaves to Horloge:
	say "He smiles at me benevolently. 'I can't drink them like that, now can I, young whot-sit?' Then he waves me away."

Instead of giving the full teacup to Horloge:
	try putting the noun on the wheeled table;

After putting the full teacup on the wheeled table:
	say "I set the cup down beside Brother Horloge's elbow. 'Excellent, there,' he says, beaming, nostrils twitching. 'Such a smell! The finest!' He lifts the cup, takes a sip and smacks his lips. 'It's the slight metallic tang that really gives it the [i]whotsit[r],' he adds. His eyes half-close in calm delight. 'Now,' he adds. 'Was there anything?'";

Definition: Horloge is sipping his tea:
	if the full teacup is on the wheeled table, yes;
	no;

Definition: Horloge is not sipping his tea:
	unless Horloge is sipping his tea, yes;
	no;

Part 7 - Central Hall

Instead of making to leave in the Central Hall: try going southwest.
Instead of going inside in the Central Hall: try going northeast.

Chapter 1 - Description

The Central Hall is east of the Library, southwest of the Upper Hall. "[if Gong Sounding is not happening]I'm standing in the very centre of the Abbey's Great Hall. [one of]It's impossible not to crane my neck at the ceiling held aloft by buttresses the size of gigantic oak trees. To think, people built this in the days before real pulley-transmissions! It must have taken [i]weeks[r]! The hall continues northeast into shadow, and southwest, towards the sunlight, the Yard and above all, the Archbishop.[paragraph break][once only]The vast empty space is filled by the muttering and echo of Holy Mechanisms, and the hiss of the candles as they sweep around their Tracks, providing a little light everywhere but rarely ever enough. I can just make out archways both east and west.[otherwise]The archway at the end of the hall, to the southwest, is clear. I can almost see the Cathedral beyond.[end if]"

Part 8 - West Refectory

Chapter 1 - Description

A room called the West Refectory is east of the Central Hall. "[if Gong Sounding is not happening]I spend some of my time here, eating at one of the two long tables. I spend even more serving the monks. Each of them has their own seat, marked by a little brass hourglass, and if the twenty or so I can see here weren't enough (which they aren't), there's more to the east, where the Refectory continues. Back west is the archway to the Great Hall.[otherwise]The Hall is back west. In a few minutes, this room will be full of confused monks. I need to not be here when that happens...[end if]"

Chapter 2 - Scenery

Section 1 - Long Table and Benches

Some long tables are a supporter, Drake-hideable, enterable, in the west refectory. The description of the long tables is "Two long oak tables flanked by benches.

Instead of putting something on the long tables:
	say "I shouldn't clutter the table. I only cleaned up here a few hours ago.";

	now the long tables are mentioned;
	
Instead of looking under the long tables:
	say "There's a lot of space there, easily enough to - say - hide from Drake."

The long tables incorporate a brass rod. 


Section 2 - Hourglasses

Some hourglasses are part of the long tables. The description is "Little polished hourglasses, each with a name inscribed at the base. They run on a metal bar so they can be easily flipped. 'There is time for eating,' so they say, 'but only the right amount of time.'[if the teacup is on the long tables] Next to Horloge's hourglass is an empty tea cup.[end if]"

Understand "brother horloge's", "horloge's",  "hourglass", "glasses" as the hourglasses.

Understand "calvin's hourglass", "drake's hourglass" as the hourglasses.

Instead of turning the hourglasses: say "The hourglasses tell the monks how long they have to eat before prayer. It's a holy Measure and not something I should play with."

Section 3 - Tea Cup

A porcelain teacup is a fake container, on the long tables. The description is "[if empty]A porcelain teacup. The edges are a little chipped from overuse.[otherwise]A steaming cup of freshly-brewed tea.[end if][if not handled] It's next to Brother Horloge's hourglass.[end if]". The printed name is "teacup".

Instead of giving the empty teacup to Horloge:
	say "Horloge peers at the cup - peers at me - peers at the cup again. His brow creases like scrumpled paper.[paragraph break]'Well, what good's that?' he demands. 'That's whotsit without the whotsit, like a whotsit with no whotsit!' He seem positively enraged.";


Instead of drinking or tasting the empty teacup:
	say "I mime sipping tea, like I was a real monk and not just a two-tooth initiate."

Instead of drinking or tasting the full teacup:
	say "I can't. It's not [i]for[r] me.";

Instead of dropping the full teacup:
	say "I didn't go to all that hassle to just put it down and have some hurrying monk knock it over!"

Part 9 - East Refectory

Chapter 1 - Description

A room called the East Refectory is east of the West Refectory, south from the Kitchen. "[if Gong Sounding is not happening]The eastern end of the long Refectory is given over in part to the tables lined with brass hourglasses, but in the other half there's nothing but the enormous Refectory Clock. It's an impressive thing, so big because it only needs winding once a year, despite all the gongs, cymbals, tubes and bells that strike when dinner time comes around. Right now, the clock is showing the time at just after [the face value of the refectory clock to the nearest five minutes in words].[otherwise]The refectory booms with the sound of the clock, striking the dining hour on a hundred bells, cymbals and organ pipes. I can retreat down the length of the dining tables to the west, or north into the kitchen.[end if]"

Instead of smelling the location when the location is the Upper Hall or the location is the East Refectory:
	say "Food, rot, cheese, mould, damp and the ever-present scent of grease-oil, coming through the archway to [the quick best route from the location to the Kitchen].";

Section 1 - Constrained Entry

Instead of going to East Refectory during Gong Sounding:
	say "No way. The coast is clear to get out of the Abbey and over to the Cathedral, but only so long as Calvin and Drake are distracted in there.";

Section 1b- Constrained Exit

Instead of going to the Abbey Herb Garden during Gong Sounding:
	say "I've made my distraction. Time to get out of here the quick way - the front door!"

Chapter 2 - Scenery

[Not faffing trying to make the long tables a combination supporter / backdrop - just repeat the object definitions instead.]

[Many moons later, and I wish I'd done this properly in the first place. Never mind.]

Section 1 - Long Table and Benches

Some long benches are a supporter, Drake-hideable, enterable, in the east refectory. The description of the long benches is "Two long oak tables flanked by benches.

Understand "table", "tables", "bench", "dining", "chair", "chairs", "seat", "seats" as the long benches.

The printed name of the long benches is "long tables".

Instead of putting something on the long benches:
	say "I shouldn't clutter the table. I only cleaned up here a few hours ago.";

Instead of entering the long benches:
	say "It's not time to eat yet. At 5pm, the gong will ring next door, and then it'll be time.";

Rule for writing a paragraph about the long benches:
	now the long benches are mentioned;

Instead of looking under the long benches:
	say "There's a lot of space there, easily enough to - say - hide from Drake."


The long benches incorporate a brass rod. 

Section 2 - Hourglasses

Some polished hourglasses are part of the long benches. The description is "Little polished hourglasses, each with a name inscribed at the base. They run on a metal bar so they can be easily flipped. 'There is time for eating,' so they say, 'but only the right amount of time.'"

The printed name of the polished hourglasses is "hourglasses".

Understand "glasses" as the polished hourglasses.

Instead of turning the polished hourglasses: say "The hourglasses tell the monks how long they have to eat before prayer. It's a holy Measure and not something I should play with."

Section 3 - Garden Door

The garden door is a locked door, east of the East Refectory and west of the Abbey Herb Garden. The description is "A low door leading out into the garden."

Instead of unlocking the locked garden door with the lucky clock key:
	say "My clock key is a clock key. It's only the right size for clocks. (And no clocks I've ever found, either.)"

Understand "low", "green", "small", "herb" as the garden door.

Rule for writing a paragraph about the garden door:
	say "Pungent smells drift in from the kitchen to the north. On the east wall is the small green door to the Abbey's herb garden[if garden door is open]. It's wide open[end if]."

Instead of opening the locked Garden Door when Horloge's keys are not carried:
	say "It's locked.";
	fire HORLOGEWALKTHROUGH1;

[ Instead of opening the locked Garden Door when Horloge's keys are carried:
	try unlocking the Garden Door with Horloge's keys. ]

An unlocking rule for the Garden Door when the player does not have Horloge's Keys:
	say "It's locked - and they don't give initiates the keys to the Abbey, normally.";
	fire HORLOGEWALKTHROUGH1;

Horloge's keys unlock the garden door.

Section 4 - Refectory Clock

The Refectory Clock is a clock, scenery, in the East Refectory. 

Instead of entering or hiding inside the Refectory Clock:
	say "[one of]I don't want to make a habit of that, you know![or]Seriously. It's a Holy Treasure. If I spend too much time standing in Holy Treasures I might get struck by a thundering bolt.[stopping]".

Instead of cleaning the Refectory Clock:
	say "I'm a few years beyond [i]that[r], to be honest.";

Rule for printing the description of the Refectory Clock when Gong Sounding is happening:
	say "The Refectory Clock is pounding out a colossal amount of noise!";

The description is "[one of]Housed in a case made of oak and glass, the inner workings of the Refectory Clock are visible, for the purpose of contemplation over dinner. In one corner is the colossal spring, about the size of an Oliphant, which powers the clock for over a year and reminds us that we need little to do much. Almost all the rest of the clock is given over to bells, hammers, whistles, gongs, organ pipes, cymbals, and other devices designed to bring even the deafest monk to dinner.[paragraph break][or]It's mostly bells. [stopping]The clock is currently set to [the face value of the refectory clock in words][if the face value of the refectory clock is before 5:00 PM]. Still a while till five o'clock, and dinner[end if].".

Understand "case/oak/wood/wooden/glass/inner/workings/spring/bells/hammers/whistles/gongs/pipes/organ/cymbals/tube/tubes" as the Refectory Clock.

The matching key of the refectory clock is Horloge's keys.

Instead of ringing the Refectory Clock during Gong Sounding:
    say "It's doing that itself already[one of]! I SAID, IT'S DOING THAT ITSELF ALREADY!![run paragraph on][once only]!"

Instead of ringing the refectory clock:
	say "The gongs can't be rung by hand. There's an extremely complicated system of piston-powered hammers for that, all ready to go off at five o'clock to call the monks for dinner.";
	if the Refectory Clock is locked and CALVINIDEA is fired and HORLOGEWALKTHROUGH1 is unfired:
		say "...And that's controlled by the hands, and the hands are inside the clockface and the clockface is locked...";
		fire HORLOGEWALKTHROUGH1;

Before attacking the Refectory Clock:
	try ringing the Refectory Clock instead.

Before attacking the Refectory Clock with something carried by the player:
	try ringing the Refectory Clock instead.

First before clock-setting the refectory clock to when the Refectory Clock is locked:

	try unlocking the Refectory Clock with Horloge's keys;
	if the Refectory Clock is unlocked, continue the action.

Instead of unlocking the locked Refectory Clock with the lucky clock key:
	say "Don't you think I've tried that before? Whatever this key opens, it's not the Refectory Clock[if Horloge's keys have not been handled] ... and the key that [i]does[r] open the Refectory Clock will belong to one of the monks. I should explore the Abbey and see what I can find[end if].";
	fire HORLOGEWALKTHROUGH1;

Before clock-setting the refectory clock to during Gong Sounding:
	say "I'm not going anywhere near the clock now it's ringing. You know what happened to the Cook when he did." instead;

Last before clock-setting the refectory clock to when the Refectory Clock is closed:
	carry out the implicitly opening activity with the refectory clock;

WARN_ABOUT_SETTING_CLOCK is a trigger.

Instead of clock-setting the refectory clock to when the refectory clock is open and WARN_ABOUT_SETTING_CLOCK is unfired:
	fire WARN_ABOUT_SETTING_CLOCK;

Rule for firing WARN_ABOUT_SETTING_CLOCK:
	say "Resetting a clock is a sacred matter, part of a ritual that considers the endless push of Sad Depreciation and the holy act of Maintainance that man must perform. The Abbot has a whole sermon for it. So to do it, just like this, on a [i]whim[r]... I can feel in my stomach that it's not right, that if Clockwork is Clockwork then there must be a better way."

After clock-setting the refectory clock to:
	if the time understood is 4:59 PM, change the time understood to 5:00 PM;
	say "[one of][if WARN_ABOUT_SETTING_CLOCK has been fired for less than three turns]But the[else]The[end if] thought of that Figure in Grey spurs me on. So I make the sign of the Winding Key - maybe that'll buy me some forgiveness when I wind down - and then I push the hands around to [the time understood in words].[or]It's horrible to be making a habit of this. Flinching, I push the hands round to [the time understood in words].[stopping]";
	consider the scene changing rules;

Instead of setting the refectory clock to when the topic understood matches "[dinner]":
	try clock-setting the refectory clock to 5:00 PM.

Understand "dinner/lunch", "time", "dinner-time", "lunch-time" as "[dinner]".

Section 5 - We see Horloge and his Keys

HORLOGEWALKTHROUGH1 is a trigger.

Rule for firing unfired HORLOGEWALKTHROUGH1:
	if Horloge's keys are not handled:
		Horloge walks through in one turn from now;
		[ we aim to prevent the player getting collared before Horloge has appeared. This may fail. ]
		now the do-pause flag of Drake is true;

At the time when Horloge walks through:
	if the location of Horloge is visited:
		say "Skip a tooth! [i]Didn't Brother Horloge have some keys? [r]In the [location of Horloge]?";
	else:
   		if the location is the East Refectory:
			say "There's a loud clunking sound and not from the clock. Then";
		else if the location is the West Refectory:
			say "At the other end of the Refectory,";
		else if the location is the Kitchen:
			say "From the south:";
		else:

		say " the garden door opens. A hooded figure comes through and locks the door again with a [i]fat bunch of keys[r]. It's Brother Horloge! He paces away, back to his place in the [location of Horloge].";


Section 6 - A backdrop object of Brother Horloge

A room can be near-to-garden. A room is seldom near-to-garden. The East Refectory, West Refectory and Kitchen are near-to-garden.

Horloge-backdrop is a backdrop. The printed name of Horloge-backdrop is "Brother Horloge". The Horloge-backdrop is privately-named, proper-named. Understand "brother", "horloge", "keys" as the Horloge-backdrop.

Before doing something with the Horloge-backdrop:
	if approaching:
		say "I head for the Library.";
		let the way be the best route from the location to the Library, using doors;
		if the way is a direction, 	try going the way instead;
	say "Brother Horloge will have gone back to the Library." instead.

After going to the Library:
	remove Horloge-backdrop from play;
	continue the action;

[ A quick hack to allow us to ask the non-existent brother horloge questions without triggering a parser error: ]

Include (- has animate, -) when defining Horloge-backdrop.

Chapter 3 - Gong Sounding

Gong sounding is a scene.

Gong sounding begins when the face value of the Refectory Clock is 5:00 PM and the Public Yard is not visited [ if you get out via the ladder, this scene should never play ]. 

When Gong Sounding begins:
	now the Refectory Clock is closed;
	remove Calvin from play;
	change the current script to { SE_CLOCK0, SE_CLOCK1, SE_CLOCK2 };

Section 1 - Gong sounding script

SE_CLOCK0 is a scripted event. The display text is "The clash of metal on metal: the Refectory Clock leaps into life like an advancing army, with bells, gongs and organ pipes ringing and chiming and clanging away! Very, very quickly, I slam shut the clock case door and, covering my ears, rush over to the other side of the room. It's still horribly loud."

SE_CLOCK1 is a scripted event. The display text is "[if the location is East Refectory]Calvin and Drake have raced into the West Refectory. 'Wren?' Drake shouts. 'Turn that thing off! It's not dinner yet!'[paragraph break]I put one hand to my ear, as if I couldn't hear him at all.[otherwise if the location is West Refectory]Calvin and Drake explode into the room and barge me out of the way as they race over to the East Refectory.[end if]";

Rule for firing SE_CLOCK1:
	move CalvinAndDrake to the West Refectory;
	if the location is West Refectory or the location is East Refectory,
		say the display text of SE_CLOCK1, paragraph break;
	otherwise do nothing;

SE_CLOCK2 is a scripted event. The display text is "Calvin and Drake race over to the clock and start struggling with the case. Both are hampered by keeping their hands over both their ears at the same time.";

Rule for firing SE_CLOCK2:
	if the location is West Refectory or the location is East Refectory or the location is Kitchen,
		say the display text of SE_CLOCK2, paragraph break;
	otherwise do nothing;

After firing SE_CLOCK2:
	remove CalvinAndDrake from play;
	if the player can see the refectory clock begin;
		say "I slip away quietly into the Kitchen.";
		move the player to the Kitchen;
	end if;

Section 2 - Dummy Calvin and Drake

CalvinAndDrake are a man. CalvinAndDrake are privately-named, proper-named, and plural-named. The printed name is "Calvin and Drake". The description is "Calvin and Drake are too busy to pay any notice of me now." Understand "Calvin", "Drake", "Calvin and Drake", "Drake and Calvin" as CalvinAndDrake.

Rule for writing a paragraph about CalvinAndDrake:
	say "Calvin and Drake are here, leaping with distraction at the sight of the booming clock." instead.

Instead of doing something when CalvinAndDrake are physically involved:
	try examining CalvinAndDrake instead;

Section 3 - Atmospheric events

Last every turn when in the Abbey Region and a random chance of 1 in 4 succeeds during Gong Sounding:
	say "[one of]The stonework resounds with the sounds of gongs.[or]The Abbey has turned into a giant trumpet, echoing the sound of bells.[or]The ringing of the Refectory Clock makes the very walls shake.[or]Gongs, bells and all manner of noises are echoing around the walls.[at random]";

Part 10 - Scriptorium

Chapter 1 - Description

A room called the Scriptorium is southwest of the Library. "The Scriptorium is where the Copying takes place, though it's hard to believe that Copying once meant a team of monks working with carved rubber stamps. It's all done by mechanisms now, of course, like everything else except my chores. There's the massive Gutenberg press on the west wall, and everywhere else is Brother Reloh's Duplicator. Twenty-three Typewriters, all clattering away as though operated by ghosts, all connected by a single Carriage Arm that curves the length of the wall. To leave the room east or northeast I'll have to duck under it."

Instead of listening when in the Scriptorium:
	say "The noise of the Duplicator is deafening - like two hundred cooks banging saucepans."

Chapter 2 - Reloh

Brother Reloh is a monk, in the Scriptorium. "Reloh works on one of the keyboards of [the Duplicator], typing furiously. The hammering and punching is almost overwhelming." The printed name is "Reloh".

The description of Reloh is "Brother Reloh is unusually young. He's also unusually pious, firm and committed to work. The only time I've ever seen him smile was when Brother Horloge sat on his spectacles right before he was supposed to read Grace. Reloh works here in the Scriptorium night and day, replicating the Proper Texts 'for the edification of...', well, pretty much everyone."

The default topic of Reloh is CT_RELOH_DEFAULT.

CT_RELOH_DEFAULT is a conversation topic. The response text is "[one of]'Be quiet,' Reloh squawks. So I'm quiet.[or]'Close your mouth,' Reloh snipes. So I close my mouth.[or]'Say nothing,' Reloh instructs. So I say nothing.[or]'I'm busy,' Reloh interrupts. So he's busy.[or]'I'm working,' Reloh snaps. So he's working.[or]'Don't make noise,' Reloh says, oblivious to the incredible thundering of all his machines.[at random]"

Chapter 3 - Duplicator

The Duplicator is a device, in the Scriptorium. The description is "The Typewriters were designed and shipped in from the North, where they weave the finest ribbons known to man. The Carriage Arm is Reloh's own invention, however, that allows him to work here, alone.[paragraph break]The Duplicator is currently producing a long and complicated document."

Understand "carriage", "arm", "typewriters", "ribbon", "ribbons" as the Duplicator.

Instead of taking or switching on or switching off or typing on the Duplicator:
	say "'Don't,' Reloh snaps. So I don't.";
	
Instead of slicing the Duplicator with the knife:
	say "I think Reloh might do something similar to [i]me[r] if I tried that."

Instead of attacking the Duplicator with the knife:
	say "I think Reloh might do something similar to [i]me[r] if I tried that."

Instead of reading or searching the Duplicator:
	say "[one of]The sheets coming out of the Writers of the Great Duplicator are titled [i]'A Defense of the Faith Against the Strange Motions of the Unsettled Masses'[r]. I read a bit.[paragraph break][i]'But for the Irony, that it is Consequentialism which causes Wronged People to accept such Heresy and Bad Thought, I would declare these Bad Thinkers to be Agents of Rust itself. However, it is their Debauchery, their lacks of Precision, both in Morality and Productivity. These things have Led them into Terrible Indecision. [']When the teeth of the flock cannot chew, they shall Slip and Spin in most Lonely Individualism.['] So sayeth...'[r][line break]It doesn't half go on.[or]I'm not reading them again.[stopping]"

Some duplicated sheets are part of the Duplicator. Understand "sheet", "paper", "papers", "document", "complicated/complex" as the duplicated sheets.

Instead of examining the duplicated sheets, try searching the Duplicator.

Instead of taking the duplicated sheets: say "Reloh would eat my head in seconds if I interfered."

Instead of researching when in the Scriptorium:
	try reading the Duplicator.
Instead of consulting the duplicated sheets about:
	try reading the Duplicator.



Chapter 4 - Gutenberg Press

The Gutenberg Press is a device, in the Scriptorium. The description is "A massive Gutenberg press, the source of all the city of St Philip's holy texts and condemnations. The recent spate of pamphlets advising against 'heretical new ideas' - whatever they might be - has run the press down rather severely. I make the sign of Sad Depreciation. Reloh sees, and nods his approval."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the Gutenberg:
	say "The Gutenberg seems to be in the midst of a repair. [The Cabinet of Relics] next to it is open.";

Instead of taking or switching on or switching off the Gutenberg:
	say "'Stop that,' Reloh barks. So I stop.";

Chapter 5 - Cabinet of Relics

Section 1 - Description

The Cabinet of Relics is a container, Drake-hideable, open, openable, scenery, in the Scriptorium. The description is "The Cabinet of Relics is open, which it shouldn't be, but presumably whichever monk was in the middle of consecrating the Gutenberg needed a three-quarter inch screw and slipped out to buy one. Inside the cabinet are typesets, spare gears, ink rollers – many objects of the Copying."

Instead of searching the Cabinet of Relics:
	try examining the press materials;

Instead of closing the Cabinet of Relics:
	say "'Leave that,' Reloh scowls. So I leave it.";

Section 2 - Press Materials

Some press materials are in the Cabinet of Relics. The description is "Typesets and other items, including a full set of new brass gears[if we know about the broken gear and the new gear is in the Cabinet of Relics]. One stands out; the same cut and bearing as the worn-down cog on the Tea Maker in the Kitchen[end if].".

Instead of taking or searching the press materials:
	say "'Don't touch those,' Reloh demands. So I don't touch."

Understand "new", "cogs", "gears", "relics", "typesets", "typeset", "brass", "items", "other", "roller", "ink", "spare", "rollers" as the press materials

Understand "gear", "cog" as the press materials when the player can not see the new gear and the player can not see the small gear;



Section 3 - New Gear

The new gear is in the cabinet of relics. The description is "A small brass gear, new cut and freshly blessed by the Filers."

Understand "brass", "cog", "fresh", "shiny", "clean", "sharp", "teeth", "new cut" as the new gear.

First for deciding the concealed possessions of the cabinet of relics:
	if the particular possession is the new gear and we do not know about the broken gear,
		yes;
	otherwise no;

To decide whether we know about the broken gear:
	if we have examined the gear train, yes;
	if we have examined the small gear, yes;
	if the small gear has been handled, yes;
	no;

To decide whether we do not know about the broken gear:
	unless we know about the broken gear, yes;
	no;

After taking the new gear:
	say "'Put that back,' Reloh snaps, without looking up. But I [i]don't[r] put it back.";

Does the player mean doing something with the small gear when the player can see the new gear:
	it is very unlikely.

Does the player mean doing something with the new gear:
	it is likely.

Part 11 - Lower Hall

Instead of going inside in the Lower Hall: try going northeast.
Instead of making to leave in the Lower Hall: try going southwest.

Chapter 1 - Description

Lower Hall is east of the Scriptorium, southwest of the Central Hall, west of the Corridor of Contemplation. The description is "[if Gong Sounding is not happening]Looking northeast, the Great Hall of the Abbey stretches away like the belly of some big beast, laid out ready to have its mouth stuffed with an apple. The walls are lit in Holy Patterns by candles on Sacred Tracks suspended in the air. There's just enough light to make out the Corridor of Contemplation to the east and the wider archway to the Scriptorium to the west.[paragraph break]But more importantly, the great Entry – and exit – of the Abbey is to the southwest. And if I'm going to get out of here and talk to the Archbishop that's the only way to go.[otherwise]The exit to the Abbey is clear to the southwest. Quickly, now, before someone turns that clock off and starts looking for someone to blame![end if]"

Index map with the Corridor of Contemplation mapped east of Lower Hall.

Chapter 2 - Scenery

Calvin is a man in Lower Hall. "[one of]But maybe you're starting to see what kind of luck I have. [once only]Right there, in the Entry, is Calvin, working on a clock." The description of Calvin is "He's hard at work – or he is whenever a monk goes past, anyway. The rest of the time he's fiddling with his hair in the reflection of the bits he's polished so far. I'm not going to be able to slip past him like that. I'm going to need to get him out of there somehow.[fire CALVINIDEA]"

Instead of going southwest from the Lower Hall in the presence of Calvin:
	say "What, just waltz past Calvin, stop. Ask the time? He'd have me by the hair in moments. No, I need some kind of plan to get him away from there.[fire CALVINIDEA]";

Instead of going southwest from the Lower Hall in the presence of Calvin when the player is carrying the caretaker's ladder:
	say "What, just slip past and pretend to be a workman? I don't think that's going to work. And it's certainly not the best use for this ladder!"


Understand "clock" as Calvin when the location of Calvin is the Lower Hall.
[Understand "entry", "arch" as Calvin when the location of Calvin is the Lower Hall.]

Instead of examining the southwest when the location of Calvin is the Lower Hall and the location is the Lower Hall:
	try examining Calvin instead.

Before attacking Calvin when the location is the Lower Hall:
	say "I've tried that before. [i]Lots[r] of times. I always lose." instead.

Instead doing something when Calvin is physically involved and the location is the Lower Hall:
	if we are searching, try examining Calvin instead;
	say "I don't want to attract his attention, do I? I want to get rid of him!"

Instead of giving something to Calvin when in the Lower Hall:
	try asking Calvin about "tea" instead.

CALVINIDEA is a trigger.

Rule for firing unfired CALVINIDEA:
	if Gong Sounding has not happened:
		Wren has an idea in one turn from now;

At the time when Wren has an idea:
	say "[i]Calvin will be guarding that door till dinner time[r], I think, angrily. So either I find a way to get him out of there, or I find some back way out of this place!"

Part 12 - Abbot's Quarters

Chapter 1 - Gubbler

Abbot Gubbler is a monk, scenery. The description is "Gubbler's staring right at me, or maybe just past my shoulder. He doesn't look very happy. His mechanical salamander is [if the mechanical salamander is working]climbing restlessly over his shoulders[otherwise]sitting motionless on the desk[end if]." The printed name is "Gubbler".

Section 2 - Salamander

The mechanical salamander is an animal, carried by Abbot Gubbler. The description is "The salamander is a wind-up pet of Gubbler's. It ratchets a little as it scurries, and near anything steep – like his upper arms – it waggles its feet uselessly and slides back down."

The mechanical salamander can be working or dormant. The mechanical salamander is working. 

Instead of doing something when the salamander is physically involved:
	say "It's not mine";

Instead of turning the mechanical salamander:
	say "I don't have the right key.";

The Gubblercounter is a counter. The top end of the Gubblercounter is 4.

Every turn when the player can see Abbot Gubbler:
	increment the Gubblercounter;

Rule for firing the Gubblercounter:
	fire entry 1 of the cycle of Gubbler;
	rotate the cycle of Gubbler backwards;

After firing ABBOT_SE5:
	now the mechanical salamander is dormant;

Section 4 - Preventing the clock doing stuff

Before opening or entering the Grandfather Clock when Drake's Patrol has happened:
	say "I don't want to give him ideas about what I've been up to!" instead.

Part 13 - Entry

Chapter 1 - Description

The Abbey Entry is southwest of the Lower Hall. "Sunlight and the sound of the city of St Philip pour in from the west through the Abbey's great doors. At last! I can get away and see the Archbishop!... before whatever happens, happens![paragraph break]To the east, a cloister runs towards the cells of the monks, novices, initiates, unaffiliated staff – really, of everyone apart from me." The printed name is "Entry".

Instead of making to leave when in the Abbey Entry: try going west instead.
Instead of going inside when in the Abbey Entry: try going east instead.

The Abbey Doors are a door, open, scenery, west of the Entry, east of the Cathedral Yard.

The description is "Ornately carved with planets, their orbits planned and plotted out for them in advance. Everything on its correct path... just as I should be!" Understand "door" as the Abbey Doors.

Instead of opening or closing the Abbey Doors:
	say "The doors would take ten men to shift, or one clever system of pulleys. Either way, I can't do a thing on my own.";

The Entry Clock is scenery, in the Entry. The description is "The great Entry Clock is tall and thin and just about visible from the street. It's half-polished. A shoddy job, but I don't have time to fix it."

The Cloisters is a room. [Except we never go there.]

The Cloister is an open door, scenery, east of the Entry, west of the Cloisters.
The description is "That way lies the cells where everyone else sleeps."
Understand "cloisters", "cells" as the Cloister.

Instead of going through the Cloister,
	say "No time to waste here. Calvin will be back as soon as they turn that clock off.";

Chapter 1 - Leaving and Finishing Chapter 2

[this is where we'll cut off the demo]

After going from the Entry to the Cathedral Yard for the first time:
	say "I race through the doors. No-one's going to stop me now! The Archbishop, and my reward - here I come!";
	end the chapter;
	now the player is in the Demo Room.
[	continue the action;]

The Demo Room is a room. "You have reached the end of the demonstration version for The Shadow in the Cathedral. Please visit www.textfyre.com to purchase the complete version."

Part 14 - Drake

Chapter 1 - Description

Drake is a man. Drake is in Upper Hall.
[ And for now that's all there is to it. ]

Section 1 - Drake can be briefly in scope

After deciding the scope of the player when the location is Drake-threatened or the location is soon to be Drake-threatened during Drake's Patrol:
	place Drake in scope.

Before examining Drake during Drake's Patrol:
	say "He looks mean, and like he's doing the loop hoping to look busy enough not get a clip round the ear, which is what I'm about to get..." instead.

Before doing something when Drake is physically involved during Drake's Patrol:
	say "He's far away and I want to keep it that way." instead.

Instead of approaching Drake during Drake's Patrol:
	say "No thanks. I don't want to run into him!"

Chapter 2 - Route

Section 1 - Patrol scene

Drake's Patrol is a scene.
Drake's Patrol begins when Introduction ends.
Drake's Patrol ends when Gong Sounding has happened or the Cathedral Yard is visited.

When Drake's Patrol ends:
	remove Drake from play;

Last Instead of listening during Drake's Patrol:
	say "[one of]I strain my ears, hoping [i]not[r] to catch the sound of footsteps[or]The stones echo tiny noises - and some not so tiny ones too, like my breathing[or]I hold my breath and listen for Drake[cycling]."

Section 2 - Route Implementation

Drake has a list of objects called the route.

The route of Drake is { Central Hall, Lower Hall, Scriptorium, Library, Central Hall, West Refectory, East Refectory, Kitchen, Upper Hall, Rickety Stair, Upper Hall }.

Drake has a truth state called can-pause flag.
Drake has a truth state called please-move flag.
Drake has a truth state called do-pause flag.
Drake has a truth state called escaped flag.


Every turn during Drake's Patrol:
	[ we give Drake a 40% chance of loitering in his location for a single turn  ]
	[  except in "dead-end" locations, where frankly, the sooner he passes by the better ]	
	if can-pause flag of Drake is true and a random chance of 4 in 10 succeeds and the location is not the Abbey Pantry and the location is not the Abbey Herb Garden and the location is not the Corridor of Contemplation and the location is not the Rickety Stair and the please-move flag of Drake is false:
		now can-pause flag of Drake is false;
	else if the do-pause flag of Drake is true:
		now the do-pause flag of Drake is false;
	else if escaped flag of Drake is true:
		now escaped flag of Drake is false;
		follow the warn of Drake's approach rule;
	else:
		move Drake one place along;
	now the please-move flag of Drake is false;

To move Drake one place along:
	now the can-pause flag of Drake is true;
	let d be the quick best route from the location of Drake to Drake's next destination;
	rotate the route of Drake backwards;
	try Drake going d;

Section 3 - Definitions

To decide which room is Drake's next destination:
	decide on entry 1 of the route of Drake;

To decide which room is Drake's future destination:
	decide on entry 2 of the route of Drake;

To decide which room is Drake's previous location:
	let N be the number of entries in the route of Drake - 1;
	decide on entry N of the route of Drake;

Definition: a room is Drake-occupied:
	if it is the location of Drake, yes;
	no;

Definition: a room is Drake-threatened:
	if it is Drake's next destination, yes;
	no;

Definition: a room is soon to be Drake-threatened:
	if it is Drake's future destination, yes;
	no;

Chapter 3 - Player Interactions

Before going to a Drake-occupied room during Drake's Patrol:
	if the location of the player is Drake's next destination:
		[ doesn't make sense if we "hang back" and then get caught anyway, so we catch that here. ]
		say "I walk right into Drake - no time to run away.[paragraph break]";
		carry out the firing activity with ATTIC1 instead;
	now the please-move flag of Drake is true;
	say "Just in time, I see Drake's there. I hang back. He'll move on in a moment." instead;

Automatically-dodging-Drake is a truth state that varies.

Before going to a Drake-threatened room when automatically-dodging-Drake is false during Drake's Patrol (this is the keep the player from entering Drake's path voluntarily rule):
	now the can-pause flag of Drake is false;
	now the please-move flag of Drake is true;
	say "[one of]I catch the sound of hobnailed boots from that direction. Drake's heading this way[or][one of]Drake! I'll keep out of his sight here[or]I spy Drake and pull back[cycling][stopping]. ";
	if the location of the player is Drake's future destination:
		now the do-pause flag of Drake is true;
		say paragraph break;
		stop the action;
	else:
		say "I'll [one of]wait and [once only]let him pass." instead;

After Drake going:
	deal with Drake and the ladder;
	abide by the warn of Drake's approach rule.

To deal with Drake and the ladder:
	if the location of Drake is the Rickety Stair and Drake is carrying the caretaker's ladder and the player is not in the Rickety Stair:
		move the ladder to the Rickety Stair;
	if the location of Drake is not the Rickety Stair and Drake can see the caretaker's ladder and the player is not carrying the caretaker's ladder:
		move the caretaker's ladder to Drake;


This is the warn of Drake's approach rule:
	if the location is the Herb Garden:
		do nothing instead;
	if the location of the player is Drake's future destination:
		let dir be the direction Drake is coming from;
		say "[one of]Distantly - but not distantly enough - I can hear the Refectory Clock and clatter of Drake's boots. The sound's coming from [the dir].[or][sound of footsteps from dir][stopping]" instead;
	otherwise if the location of the player is Drake's next destination:
		let dir be the direction Drake is coming from;
		say "[one of]Drake's coming! [or]Looking [dir], I can see Drake. He's coming this way! [or]Drake's just off to [the dir], and he's coming this way! [or]I've got a moment before Drake spots me: he's just appeared, to [the dir]. [as decreasingly likely outcomes]";
		if the location is the Rickety Stair:
			if the caretaker's ladder is in the location:
				say "The only way out, is up!";
			else:
				say "There's nowhere to run and nowhere to hide!";
		else:
			say "[one of]I can escape[or]Escape lies[or]I'd better disappear[or]Time to leave: I can go[at random] [or-separated list of Drake-viable directions]." instead;
	otherwise if the location of the player is the location of Drake:
		[ sometimes, we let the player escape ]
		if a random chance of 40 in 100 succeeds:
			let the way be a random Drake-viable direction;
			if the way is a direction:
				say "Drake [one of]appears[or]enters[or]comes into the room[as decreasingly likely outcomes]: I [one of]dive[or]hurry[or]dash[or]scamper[or]almost crawl[as decreasingly likely outcomes] away [way].";
				now automatically-dodging-Drake is true;
				try going the way;
				now the escaped flag of Drake is true;
				now automatically-dodging-Drake is false;
				rule succeeds;
		carry out the firing activity with ATTIC1 instead;
	otherwise if the number of moves from the location to the location of Drake is greater than 1 and the number of moves from the location to Drake's previous location is 1:
		[so he's moving away from you, and you're waiting behind him]
		say "[one of]I hear footsteps, moving away into the Abbey[or][one of]Footsteps[if location is Attic Room], downstairs[end if] - moving away[or]I hear footsteps, receding[or]The stones echo departing footsteps[as decreasingly likely outcomes][stopping]." instead;
	continue the action;

To say sound of footsteps from (d - a direction):
	say "[one of]Drake, approaching from [the d]![or]Drake's footsteps echo in from [the d].[or]Drake's clattering boots are audible to [the d].[or]Drake's on patrol, and I can hear him heading this way, from [the d].[as decreasingly likely outcomes]";

To decide which direction is the direction Drake is coming from:
	let x be the Attic Room;
	if the location of the player is Drake's next destination begin;
		now x is the location of Drake;
	otherwise if the location of the player is Drake's future destination;
		now x is the Drake's next destination;
	end if;
	decide on the quick best route from the location of the player to x;

Definition: a direction (called the way) is Drake-viable:
	[ We find directions that Drake isn't at, ignoring inside and outside, up and down because they're ugly ]
	if the way is outside or the way is inside or the way is up or the way is down, no;
	let the new place be the room the way from the location;
	if the new place is not a room, no;
	[ is it through the garden door - specific, I know, but it'll do ]
	if the way is east and the location is the East Refectory and the garden door is locked, no;
	[is the player trying to go through the Entry ]
	if the way is southwest and the location is the Lower Hall, no;
	[ is he there? ]
	if the new place is the location of Drake, no;
	[ was he there? - stops the player swapping rooms with him ]
	if the location of Drake is the location and the new place is Drake's previous location, no;
	yes;

Chapter 4 - Hiding from Drake

Section - Times you can't hide

Instead of hiding under something Drake-hideable when the location is not Drake's next destination and the location is not Drake's future destination during Drake's Patrol:
	say "I don't need to hide. Drake's not on me quite yet.";
	now the do-pause flag of Drake is true;

Instead of hiding inside something Drake-hideable when the location is not Drake's next destination and the location is not Drake's future destination during Drake's Patrol:
	say "I don't need to hide. Drake's not on me quite yet.";
	now the do-pause flag of Drake is true;

Instead of hiding behind something Drake-hideable when the location is not Drake's next destination and the location is not Drake's future destination during Drake's Patrol:
	say "I don't need to hide. Drake's not on me quite yet.";
	now the do-pause flag of Drake is true;

Before hiding under or hiding behind or hiding inside or hiding from view when the caretaker's ladder is carried by the player: 
	now the do-pause flag of Drake is true;
	say "How I'm supposed to hide when I'm carrying this stupid ladder around?" instead.

Section - Hiding and moving Drake on

Instead of hiding from view when Drake's Patrol is happening:
	say "There's nowhere to hide here.";

Instead of hiding from view when Drake's Patrol is happening and something Drake-hideable is visible:
	try hiding inside a random Drake-hideable visible thing;

Instead of hiding under something Drake-hideable during Drake's Patrol:
	hide from Drake inside the noun;

Instead of hiding inside something Drake-hideable during Drake's Patrol:
	hide from Drake inside the noun;

Instead of hiding behind something Drake-hideable during Drake's Patrol:
	hide from Drake inside the noun;

To hide from Drake inside (t - a thing):
	say "[one of]Good thinking![paragraph break][once only]I duck behind [the t], just in time! Drake marches through the room. Once he's gone, I slip back out";
	move Drake away;
	if Drake was not carrying the caretaker's ladder and Drake is carrying the caretaker's ladder:
		say ", to find the ladder's gone";
	say ".";

To move Drake away:
	while Drake's previous location is not the location:
		move Drake to Drake's next destination;
		rotate the route of Drake backwards;
		deal with Drake and the ladder;
	now the do-pause flag of Drake is true;

Section - Places you can't hide

Instead of hiding behind something during Drake's Patrol:
	say "[one of]I can't hide there![or]That's no good![or]That would never work![cycling]"

Instead of hiding inside something during Drake's Patrol:
	say "[one of]I can't hide in there![or]That's no good![or]That would never work![cycling]"

Instead of hiding under something during Drake's Patrol:
	say "[one of]I can't hide there![or]That's no good![or]That would never work![cycling]"

Part 15 - The Abbey, as a region

The Abbey Region is a region. The Abbot's Quarters, Corridor of Contemplation, Attic Room, Rickety Stair, Upper Hall, Kitchen, Library, Central Hall, West Refectory, East Refectory, Scriptorium, Lower Hall, Abbey Pantry, Abbey Herb Garden and Abbey Entry are in the Abbey Region.

The Abbey of Time is a backdrop in the Abbey Region. Understand "stones", "ancient/old stone/stones" as the Abbey of Time. "The Abbey is where I've lived all my life. It's not big when you've been around it as often as I have - but it's full of small corners."

Before doing something when the backdrop-walls are involved and the Abbey of Time is visible:
	redirect the action from the backdrop-walls to the Abbey of Time, and try that instead.

Before climbing the Abbey of Time:
	say "I'm pretty desperate to get out right now, it's true!" instead;

Before doing something when the Abbey of Time is physically involved and the action is physical:
	say "The Abbey has been here for longer than anyone can remember, and will be here for longer again." instead.





Part 16 - Herb Garden

[ A hint ]

After going from the East Refectory to the Abbey Herb Garden:
	say "[one of]Outside the Abbey! If it weren't for the tall walls around the garden, I'd be in the street and running round to the Cathedral in a second's-swish![or]I'm back in the garden. Just the walls between me and freedom![once only]";
	continue the action.

The Abbey Herb Garden is a room. "[one of]Standing in the garden is a bit like walking on tilting floorboards: every step you take has an unexpected spring to it. That's because where the ground should be there's a large metal disc with a large glass lens at its centre, on which all the soil beds are laid out like numbers on a clock. As the day goes on, the disc revolves so that the plants can follow the sunlight until at night, when disappear safely under the metal hood built into the south wall[or]Right now, [if the plants are day-plants]the lens in the centre of the great disc of the garden is bathed in light and the day-plants are out: basil, thyme, potatoes, other vegetables. The mushroom beds are under the metal hood on the south wall[else]the night-plants are out: mushrooms and nightcaps and fungi, and the day-plants are under the metal hood, safe from snails and birds[end if][if there is something on the large lens]. The lens is covered by [the list of things on the large lens][end if][stopping].[paragraph break]Otherwise, there are tall walls on three sides and only one door, back into the Abbey, to the west."

Instead of going inside when in the Abbey Herb Garden: try going west instead.
Instead of making to leave when in the Abbey Herb Garden: try going up instead.

Instead of facing west when in the Abbey Herb Garden:
	try examining the garden door instead.

Rule for printing the description of the garden door when in the Abbey Herb Garden:
	if the garden door is closed:
		say "The garden door is closed.";
	else:
		say "The interior of the Abbey is shadowy: too dark to see."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the garden door when in the Abbey Herb Garden:
	now the garden door is mentioned;

Every turn when in the Abbey Herb Garden and a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:
	say "[one of]The garden underfoot ticks slowly around.[or]The plants are glowing under the beautiful sunshine.[or]The sunlight makes my back prick with sweat.[or]Butterflies flit between the flowers.[or]A few insects buzz through the leaves.[or]Smells lift from the plants.[or]Birds flit by overhead.[or]Sunlight gleams off [if plants are day-plants]the lens in the centre of the garden[else]the metal floor of the garden, but doesn't hit the covered lens[end if].[at random]";

Instead of jumping in the Abbey Herb Garden:
	say "The floor rocks a little when I land."

Instead of going nowhere when in the Abbey Herb Garden:
	say "There's a high wall that way."

Instead of going down when in the Abbey Herb Garden:
	say "I can't dig my way out of the Abbey! (I don't think I can, anyway. Not through a solid metal plate, anyway.)"

Section 2 - scenery - walls

Some garden walls are scenery in the Herb Garden. "The walls are nine or ten feet of smoothed-down stone, to stop climbers and creepers, human and vegetable alike. (Shame, since on the other side of the wall is the side of the Abbey, and that means a quick run to the Cathedral.)" Understand "wall" as the garden walls.

Instead of jumping over or climbing the garden walls: 
	say "[one of]Over the walls would get me round the side of the Abbey and straight to the Cathedral... but the walls are too smooth to climb and much too high to jump.[or]Getting over them - great idea[one of]. Getting over them without spring-loaded boots or a grappling line - not so likely[once only].[stopping]"

Instead of jumping when in the Abbey Herb Garden:
	try jumping over the garden walls.

Instead of attacking or pushing or pulling the garden walls: 
	say "They've been built to withstand cannonfire. There's not much I can do to change that."

The herb garden is exterior. [This hides the usual interior walls.]

Section - The Ladder in the Herb Garden

Rule for writing a paragraph about the caretaker's ladder when in the Herb Garden:
	say "The caretaker's ladder is propped up against the garden wall."

Instead of going up in Herb Garden when the ladder is in the Herb Garden:
	try climbing the ladder.

Instead of going up in Herb Garden when the ladder is not in the Herb Garden:
	if the ladder is carried:
		try dropping the ladder;
		try climbing the ladder instead;
	try climbing the garden walls;

Instead of climbing the ladder when in the Herb Garden:
	say "In a flash, I'm up and over! It's a short fall to the alley behind the wall, then I scamper along a shadowy alleyway and out into the Cathedral Yard. I'm clear! Time to go see the Archbishop!";
	end the chapter;
	[move the player to the Demo Room;]
	move the player to the Cathedral Yard;

Instead of climbing the garden walls when the caretaker's ladder is visible:
	try going up.

Instead of pushing or pulling or turning the caretaker's ladder when the caretaker's ladder is in the Herb Garden:
	say "The ladder is firmly in place, its toes dug a little into the soil."


Section 3 - background animals

Some creatures are scenery, animals, in the Abbey Herb Garden. Understand "birds/bird/insect/insects/bee/bees/butterfly/butterflies" as the creatures. "The garden is alive with small things."

Instead of taking the creatures: say "They're busy. So, remember, am I."

Part 17 - Locative glimpse backdrops to navigate by

The Refectory-Glimpse is a locative glimpse backdrop, in the Kitchen, localising the East Refectory. 

Instead of smelling the Refectory-Glimpse: say "It doesn't smell anything like as much as the kitchen does."

The CC_glimpse is a locative glimpse backdrop in the Lower Hall, localising the Corridor of Contemplation.

The UHALL_glimpse is a locative glimpse backdrop in the Kitchen, localising the Upper Hall.

The HALL_glimpse is a locative glimpse backdrop in the Library, in the Rickety Stair, in the Attic Room, in the East Refectory, in the West Refectory, in the Abbey Herb Garden, in the Entry, in the Corridor of Contemplation, in the Abbot's Quarters, localising the Central Hall.

The LHALL_glimpse is a locative glimpse backdrop in the Scriptorium, localising the Lower Hall.

The KITCHEN_glimpse is a locative glimpse backdrop in the Library, in the Scriptorium, in the Central Hall, in the Lower Hall, in the Upper Hall, in the Rickety Stair, in the Attic Room, in the East Refectory, in the West Refectory, in the Abbey Herb Garden, in the Entry, in the Corridor of Contemplation, in the Abbot's Quarters, localising the Kitchen.

The SCRIPT_glimpse is a locative glimpse backdrop in the Library, in the Kitchen, in the Central Hall, in the Lower Hall, in the Upper Hall, in the Rickety Stair, in the Attic Room, in the East Refectory, in the West Refectory, in the Abbey Herb Garden, in the Entry, in the Corridor of Contemplation, in the Abbot's Quarters, localising the Scriptorium.

The ABBEYLIBRARY_glimpse is a locative glimpse backdrop in the Kitchen, in the Scriptorium, in the Central Hall, in the Lower Hall, in the Upper Hall, in the Rickety Stair, in the Attic Room, in the East Refectory, in the West Refectory, in the Abbey Herb Garden, in the Entry, in the Corridor of Contemplation, in the Abbot's Quarters, localising the Library.

Chapter 2 - The Machinery

The revolving metal plate is scenery in the Herb Garden. "The entire garden floor is one revolving metal plate, set on castors, that ticks slowly round to follow the motion of the sun around the garden. There's even a low cover at one end, to shield the plants from interested birds at four in the morning.[paragraph break]In the centre is the large lens that drives the mechanism." 

Understand "disc", "floor", "garden" as the revolving metal plate.

Instead of taking or pushing or attacking the metal plate: say "It's enormous: would take four men just to roll it into place. The garden walls were probably built around it."

Instead of looking under the metal plate: say "There are castors there - I can't see them, but I'm a believer in clockwork - I don't have to see it to know it's there."

Instead of setting or turning the metal plate: say "It doesn't have any levers or pulleys. The whole plate is powered by the rays of the sun, focused through the lens at its centre."

Understand "castors/castor" as the revolving metal plate.

Instead of entering the metal plate:
	say "Where do you think I'm standing now?"

Section 2 - giant lens

The large lens is a supporter, part of the revolving metal plate. The description of the large lens is "The lens drives the mechanism, by collecting sunlight and using it to heat a spring of copper underneath the plate. The spring then winds and unwinds as it extends and shrinks, and the plate turns around - keeping the day-plants, herbs and vegetables, in the best sunshine possible, and at night, letting the mushrooms come out to collect the dew[if there is something on the large lens].[paragraph break]On the lens is [the list of things on large lens][end if].";

Instead of looking through the large lens:
	say "Peering through the lens I can just see the outline of the gigantic copper spring that drives the garden round and around."

Instead of looking under the large lens:
	say "Looking under I can't do. Through might be more possible."

Instead of entering the large lens:
	say "I can't pass through glass. Only springs of light can go through glass!"

Instead of standing on the large lens:
	say "I might break the glass. (Or get it really muddy.)";

To revolve into daytime:
	now the plants are day-plants;
	remove the short stake from play;
	say 	"[one of]The garden revolves back as light hits the lens once more. The herbs and vegetables come out of hiding into the sunshine! [or]The lens lights up and the day-beds revolve back out from the under the cover[stopping][one of]. The movement almost knocks me over[or]. I have to balance to stay upright as the plate turns[or][cycling].";

To revolve into nighttime:
	now the plants are night-plants;
	if the knife is not handled, move the short stake to the Abbey Herb Garden; 
	say "[one of]There's a pause, and then the whole garden begins to revolve! The day-plants move under the shade of the metal hood, and the night-plants - mushrooms and fungi - emerge in their place[or]The garden revolves once more, bringing the night-plants back into view[stopping][if knife is not handled]. Stuck in the beds amongst them is a short stake[end if].";

Instead of closing or touching the large lens when the plants are day-plants:
	say "I put both hands over the lens. ";
	revolve into nighttime;

Definition: something is away from the lens if it is not the large lens and it is not enclosed by the player.

Before doing something in the Abbey Herb Garden when something away from the lens is physically involved or going west: 
	if there is no thing on the large lens and the plants are night-plants:
		say "I lift my hand away from the lens. ";
		revolve into daytime;
		if the short stake is physically involved or the plants are physically involved, stop the action;
	continue the action;

Before putting the tumbler on the large lens:
	say "The glass wouldn't block the light. Glass doesn't block light-springs. The Abbot says so." instead.

Before putting something on the large lens:
	if the noun is not the rag:
		say "[The noun] [is-are] tiny compared to the size of the lens." instead;

After putting something on the large lens:
	say "I cover the lens with [the noun]. ";

Instead of eating or tasting or touching or taking or pulling or attacking the night-plants plants:
	say "Plenty of these mushrooms are grown for the Apothecary. Some might drive you mad, or blind, or worse. I'm not touching any." 

Instead of smelling in the Herb Garden:

	remove the gigantic Tome from play;
	remove the short stake from play;
	move the knife to the player;
	now the knife is handled;
	now the knife is a garden-knife;
	say "I pull the stake free of the soil, only to find it's the handle of a gardener's knife! Someone must have left it here by accident. Still, could be useful if I meet any Grey Figures..."

Understand "short", "stake" as the knife when the knife is a garden-knife.
Understand "handle" as the knife when the player cannot see the dowel handle and the player cannot see the makeshift torch.

The Cathedral Yard is a room, exterior, in the Cathedral Space. "The Yard is where we go on Saturdays for exercise, cleaning up the muck left behind by the market (worse once a month when the horse-traders from the south come up and leave their presents for the Abbey gardens). Today it's quiet, at least, with the space between the Abbey to the east and the Cathedral to the west empty but for the usual collection of beggars, unfortunates, wretches and the disadvantaged poor.[one of][paragraph break]The Cathedral really is enormous – but it doesn't have many rooms, so finding the Archbishop shouldn't take too long. Which is lucky, because I don't know how long I've got before Gubbler – and the mysterious Figure – put their plan into action. If I warn the Archbishop too late it'll be no good. He might just blame me for whatever it is they're planning to steal![once only]"

Instead of going east in the Cathedral Yard:
	say "No, I need to find the Archbishop, not get rounded up by Calvin and Drake and set to work polishing again[if Gong Sounding is happening]. Besides, by the sound of the clock, it's 5pm in there, which would be far too late![else].[end if]"

That's what it's like to stand in here, and this is just the Entry to the massive Cathedral further north (I guess in there you'll need to imagine an ant inside a church bell).[paragraph break]Let me try and do better. The main doors to the street are south and about as tall as the Abbey itself, so they need a lot of space just to fit the hinges in (those are about as big as me, I think). I came in from the Yard by the east door; there's another similar door west but it's locked right now - the Cathedral is closed to the public most of the time.[paragraph break]Looking northwards I can see the long Nave, and the altar beyond.

Part 3 - Lower Nave

Chapter 1 - Description

Of course, it's also closer to the Altar to the north (and further from the draught coming up from the doors to the south).[paragraph break]A group of monks are standing around the altar, singing softly[if East Clerestory is not visited].

Standing on tip-toes I can see a ball-bearing, wearily wending its way along a grooved path in the surface of the board. As it reaches one side, there is a loud cheer from the monks – the board tilts – and the ball continues back the other way.

All is quiet.[or]The machine makes an almost imperceptible [i]click[r]. The lead monk steps down and is lost in the crowd of monks. A great chant goes up: 'In Perpetuum, In Mobilis, Forever and Ever, Happen! Happen!'[or]A new monk steps up from the group. He looks a tiny bit younger than the previous lead monk. 'In the name of the Lever,' he declares.[or]'The Lever!' cry the other monks.[or]'In the name of the ...' the lead monk continues. Whatever he's about to say is smothered by a booming [i]clonk[r] from the Cathedral clock machinery above.

Chapter 1 - West Apse

The West Apse is west of the Cathedral Altar, in the Cathedral Space. "There are more pews, though there's clearly one row missing, which Drake says is the one they took and chopped up to make the floorboards of my room. I don't believe it – why would anyone waste such a good bit of wood on me?[paragraph break]Anyway, the altar is back east and there's another archway in the southwest corner of the room.

The Nave is back east, should any of this prove dull.[otherwise]This shrine contains the Calendar Unlimited, which I'm pretty sure is the thing St Philip built to get a city a named after him. It's ticking away quietly next to the brass brazier.

[or]. [stopping]It's called the 'Orrery' and it's meant to depict the movements of the heavens, though to me it looks more like the badly-mangled bicycles they dredge from the river and sell on Saturday's for scrap, and how anyone's meant to read the whirls of discs, balls, wire hoops and spindles is beyond me[stopping].

[i]Tight-fisted[r] ogres, they always demand a sheet of my parchment in return for [i]every one[r] of theirs.'[paragraph break]He grins, as if he's just made a joke, and holds up a sheet of paper – it's a work order of some description, but I can't read more before he flaps it down on the table again. 'Run along with it, then.' He returns his gaze to the orrery.";

After firing SAATEVENT1:

His skin is so pale I'm not sure he's ever been outside.[paragraph break]He's wearing a ring, bearing the Cathedral's seal, though it's too small to see what the seal is. As Drake once said to me, 'That ring gives him the right to demands things off monks same as I demand things off [i]you[r].'[paragraph break][if sat at his desk]Sa'at sits behind his desk, regarding the orrery through cool eyes.[otherwise]Sa'at paces around the orrery, trying to work out what needs fixing.[end if]"

Of Astronomers. They don't want just anyone barging in and saying, [']Will my crops fail?['], [']What about little Billy's hypothermia?['] You've no idea what a hassle people are. And they're everywhere! You go outside, you can't [i]move[r] for people!' He stops suddenly, and goes quiet."

The response text is "[if the letter state of Brother Sa'at is 0]'No. Books are for looking things up in,' Sa'at says firmly. 'Not for reading. Start-to-finish is best left for writers and writers alone.'[otherwise if the letter state of Brother Sa'at is 1]'Principia Planetaria. Newton. Now get it quickly, before I calcify on the spot,' he says.[otherwise]'The good-est,' he scowls, sarcastically. 'Best thing Newton ever did. All this nonsense with penduluums.' He shakes his head, then rounds on me. 'Now, don't listen to me, or you'll get into a lot of trouble, understand? And you'll only get out of it if you're very, very clever.

But a [i]book[r]? You don't find books in the heavens! You find books in [i]catalogues[r] and [i]indices[r]!' He is almost red in the face, except he probably doesn't have the blood in him.".

The response text is "[if Brother Sa'at is inspecting his orrery]'I don't know what you did,' he replies menacingly. 'But when I fix it I don't expect to see it go wrong again. It's most upsetting.' He winds his hands in despair.[otherwise]'Every gear and trace,' he says proudly. 'Years ago now and I still don't fully understand it. It's a marvel. A [i]mystery[r]. I spend night after night,' – his eyes are filling with tears now – 'just contemplating it. You have to look at the right [i]times[r], you see.' He's shaking.

CT_SAAT_WAX is a conversation topic. 

The enquiry text is "'Where can I get wax from?' I ask.".
The response text is "'Where does wax come from?' Sa'at repeats, seemingly absolutely astonished. 'Where do you [i]think[r] wax comes from, idiot? Where else [i]could[r] wax come from? Wax comes out of the back-end of [i]bees[r], obviously!' He scratches his nose. 'Of course, it's not purple yet then. Gets turned into candles and I don't know what else.' Thinks.

The response text is "'[i]Bureaucracy[r] is never [i]finished[r]. Oh, no. If it was [i]finished[r] maybe some of us could get on [i]without[r] all this looking-up-coordinates, and stamping-things-with-wax, and all this sort of [i]rot[r]. I mean, what good is a [i]stamp[r]? We've got whole rooms of [i]machines[r] stamping out everything from [i]books[r] to [i]rats[r], it's not like stamping is [i]difficult[r]. It's simply fiddly.' He pokes me in the shoulder. 'When you're bigger, you should do something [i]about[r] it, do you understand?'"

The response text is "'Well, it's so I can [i]work[r],' he explains, with barely-concealed contempt. 'I know it's [i]hard[r] to believe but this orrery of mine isn't [i]complete[r]. How am I supposed to understand the [i]universe[r] when I don't know where everything [i]is[r]?'"

CT_SAAT_ASTRONOMERS  is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'Who are the astronomers?' I ask Brother Sa'at."

CT_SAAT_ME is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'Do you know who I am?' I ask." The response text is "'Of course I don't,' he snaps. 'I don't have the [ifaintest[r] interest or clue. You're a [i]small[r] one.' Suddenly, a thought seems to strike him. His face pulls back in horror. 'Oh, Good [i]Grease[r], you're no the child of someone [i]important[r], are you, from the Council of [i]Scientists[r]?' He peers. 'Oh, [i]no[r], of course not. Someone like that wouldn't be nearly as [i]dirty[r] as you are. Never mind, then.'";

Section 3 - Idle Actions

The Sa'atCounter is a counter. The top end is 4. The internal value is 2. [We have the 'work order' event on the first turn we enter.]

Every turn when the player can see Brother Sa'at:
	if Brother Sa'at is not inspecting his Orrery:
		increment the Sa'atCounter;

Rule for firing the Sa'atCounter:
	say "[one of]The orrery quietly revolves.[or]Something the orrery does – though I can't see a thing different – makes Sa'at clap his hands in delight.[or]Sa'at's eyes dart across the wheel of his orrery like he was reading a book.[or]The gears on the orrery slowly tug at the distant comets over the doorway.[or]Sa'at jots a note to himself, very quickly, almost without seeing what it says.[at random]"

Chapter 3 - Work Order

A work order is carried by Brother Sa'at. The description is "The order outlines the need for a map of a Nebula, whatever that is[if the letter state of Brother Sa'at is 4]. It's official: stamped in purple wax with the Cathedral icon[end if]."

Chapter 6 - Orrery

The Orrery Machine is a thing, scenery in the Orrery Hall. "The machine is centred around a large gold ball that's meant to look like the sun (but I've seen the sun, and not only does it change size it changes colour too – much redder after dinner, much like Brother Horloge's cheeks). Around that centre are wide hoops of thin wire which are slowly revolving, sliding and spinning over one another. Fixed to them are coloured balls – planets – and pressed brass discs bearing the symbols of the major constellations. Further off, in the very corners of the chamber, are comets, asteroids and a few galaxies."

	say "'Get away,' Sa'at insists, and pushes me back, so hard that it hurts.";

Instead of doing something when the Orrery Machine is physically involved:
	now Brother Sa'at is inspecting his Orrery;

I grab one of the wheels of the orrery and push it onwards, just a bit.[paragraph break]Sa'at's on his feet in seconds, knowing something's wrong just by the [i]sound[r]. He starts to pace around the edge of the machine, peering at it and fretting. Strangely, he doesn't tell me off. It's like he can't see me at all.";

At the time when Brother Sa'at fixes the problem:
	now Brother Sa'at is sat at his desk;
	if the player can see Brother Sa'at begin;
		say "Sa'at suddenly chortles with delight. With one hand he tweaks one of the wheels of the machine: nothing seems to change, but he's immediately satisfied and returns to his desk, beaming.";
	end if;

Section 2 - Parts of the Orrery machine

Some parts of the Orrery are privately-named, part of the Orrery Machine. The description is "[one of]All the parts of the Orrery are lovingly crafted.[or]Sa'at must have spent a lifetime polishing these.[or]No detail is left undetailed.[cycling]".

Understand "space", "ball", "balls", "brass", "disc", "discs" as the parts of the Orrery.

Instead of doing something when the parts of the Orrery are physically involved and the action is physical:
	try taking the Orrery Machine instead.

An Orrery-part is a kind of thing. Every orrery-part is part of the Orrery Machine. An orrery-part is privately-named.

	try taking the Orrery Machine instead.
Instead of doing something when an orrery-part is physically involved:

'Seal and sign. They always say, seal and sign. I've signed, but oh, no, not good enough, is it?' He begins the process of hunting around again.[paragraph break]'Do you need another book?' I ask.[paragraph break]'No. Idiot,' he says. 'I need some wax for sealing with. Official business, has to be purple wax, none of this empty-your-ear business that was perfectly good enough a few years ago. Oh no. The world's gone mad, I tell you.' He winds his hands together quite unexpectedly. 'Mad.'"

After taking the work order when the letter state of Brother Sa'at is less than 4:
	say "I slip the work order off his desk while he's distracted with the orrery. 'You!' he boils. Not distracted enough. But he doesn't snatch it back. 'Don't do that!' He's too wrapped up watching his machine to actually do anything – just shakes his fist, and then gets back to work." instead;

The [i]Society[r] is in Paris, as I'm sure you know, so you'll [i]have[r] to get the boat from Port Hauter, it's about three days in one of those [i]wagon-things[r] they let children ride.

Once it's run down, the wax inside has melted enough for Sa'at to dribble a few drops onto the work order and then stamp it with his ring.[paragraph break]'Good,' he announces. 'That's that. [i]Bureaucracy[r] appeased. No need to wax [i]lyrical[r] about it.' He rubs his hands, chortles to himself, then abruptly stops and returns to his work. I'm roundly ignored in all this, of course."

Instead of giving a wax lump to Brother Sa'at when the letter state of Brother Sa'at is 4:
	say "'Yes, very good,' Sa'at says with a sigh. 'It's already sealed, so you can put your nasty wax away.'"

Part 12 - Cyclical Library

Chapter 1 - Description

The Cyclical Library is southwest of the Library Archway, in the Cathedral Space. "[one of]The Library of the Cathedral of Time is about as much like the one in the Abbey as the mould on the floorboards of my room is like the oak tree standing outside the Cathedral gate. [once only]This room is massive, and mechanised. Little blocks of shelving, holding about twenty books each, tile the cylindrical wall in a kind of mosaic, but they're all fixed up to winches, pulleys, and the whole room can revolve, so instead of you going to a find a book... well, you get the idea."

Instead of making to leave when in the Cyclical Library: try going northeast instead.
Instead of going inside in the Cyclical Library: try going northeast instead.

Section 2 - Event on Entry moved to examining shelves and things

LIBRARYEVENT1 is a trigger.

Rule for firing unfired LIBRARYEVENT1:
	say "(You might be wondering where all the power for these big machines comes from. The story goes that when St Philip founded the city, he made sure to build the cathedral on a spring.)";

After examining the contraption when LIBRARYEVENT1 is unfired:
	fire LIBRARYEVENT1;

After examining the bookshelves when LIBRARYEVENT1 is unfired:
	fire LIBRARYEVENT1;

After examining the controls when LIBRARYEVENT1 is unfired:
	fire LIBRARYEVENT1;

Chapter 2 - Scenery

Section 1 - Initiates

Some initiates are people, in the Cyclical Library. "Between where I am, and the monks around the altar back in the Cathedral, comes a long period with a shaved head but no dining rights. The boys here are studying hard because they're getting hungry."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the initiates:
	now the initiates are mentioned.

Understand "monk", "monks", "reader", "readers", "initiate", "boys", "kids", "guys" as the initiates.

Instead of doing something when the initiates are physically involved:
	say "I'd better not disturb them.";

Before asking the initiates about:
	say "I'm not meant to disturb them. They're deep in study." instead.
Before telling the initiates about:
	say "I'm not meant to disturb them. They're deep in study." instead.
Before shouting at the initiates:
	say "I'm not meant to disturb them. They're deep in study." instead.

Section 2 - Library Tables

Some library tables are a supporter, scenery, in the cyclical library. "A few long tables for working."

Understand "table", "desks", "desk", "long tables" as the library tables.

Instead of searching the library tables when the gigantic tome is visible:
	say "On one of the tables is a gigantic Tome."

Section 3 - Bookshelves

Some bookshelves are scenery, in the Cyclical Library. "The bookshelves form a giant's jigsaw on the wall, right the way around. They're all rigged and pulleyed so the order can be changed at will. The whole process is controlled by an oddly-small contraption in the centre of the room, that dangles down from the ceiling."

Understand "books", "shelf", "shelves" as the bookshelves.

Instead of doing something when the bookshelves are physically involved:
	say "Even the nearest one is far above my reach. They have to be, otherwise anytime a book was ordered using the controls in the centre of the room, someone might be crushed by a flying bookcase.";

Section 4 - Contraption

A contraption is in the Cyclical Library. "This is all controlled by a gold-panelled contraption that dangles from the ceiling like a chandelier they forgot to hoist. It's got three main controls. Occasionally, one of the initiates going through the studying phase of their education goes up and takes a look, but they seem nervous to touch it, for some reason."

Understand "chandelier", "machine" as the contraption.

The description is "Suspended from the centre of the ceiling the contraption is covered in controls. Somehow what you select down here on ground level gets fed into the mechanism that controls the walls. There must be wires running up inside the tubes and turning cogs overhead. "

Instead of doing something when the contraption is physically involved:
	if attacking, say "I'd get in trouble if I did that." instead;
	say "You'd need to be specific on which control I should use, and how.";

Instead of entering or climbing the contraption:
	say "[one of]I'd have half the Cathedral down on me in seconds if I tried that![or]No chance. I'm not looking make a distraction, here![cycling]";

Some controls are part of the contraption. The description is "The controls consist of three cranks (one steel, one brass and one gold), beneath which are three rotating cylindrical dials engraved with numerals and the letters X, Y and Z, showing [i][value of X control], [value of Y control], [value of Z control][r]. Next to all this is an iron chain that runs right back up to the ceiling."

Understand "tumblers", "numbers", "values", "numerals", "cranks", "cylindrical", "dials", "meters", "main controls", "three controls" as the controls.

Instead of doing something when the controls is physically involved:
	if attacking, say "I'd get in trouble if I did that." instead;
	say "You'd need to be specific on which control I should use, and how.";

Instead of using or switching on the controls:
	say "If I just mess about at random with these things I'll probably turn the whole library inside out. Best to be specific. Which control, which way?";

The X control is a Cartesian Control. The metal of the X control is "steel". The letter is "X". The coordinate is 5.7.
The Y control is a Cartesian Control. The metal of the Y control is "brass". The letter is "Y". The coordinate is 1.1.
The Z control is a Cartesian Control. The metal of the Z control is "gold". The letter is "Z". The coordinate is 6.8. 

The X meter is a privately-named Cartesian Meter, part of the controls. The model of the X meter is the X control. 
The Y meter is a privately-named Cartesian Meter, part of the controls. The model of the Y meter is the Y control.

Understand "steel meter", "x meter", "meter" as the X meter.
Understand "brass meter", "y meter", "meter" as the Y meter.
Understand "gold meter", "z meter", "meter" as the Z meter.

Understand "cylindrical", "control", "dial" as a Cartesian Meter.

The X crank is a privately-named Cartesian Crank, part of the controls. The model of the X crank is the X control. The meter of the X crank is the X meter. 

The Y crank is a privately-named Cartesian Crank, part of the controls. The model of the Y crank is the Y control. The meter of the Y crank is the Y meter. 

The Z crank is a privately-named Cartesian Crank, part of the controls. The model of the Z crank is the Z control. The meter of the Z crank is the Z meter. 

Understand "x crank", "steel crank", "steel", "x", "crank" as the X crank.
Understand "y crank", "brass crank", "brass", "y", "crank" as the Y crank. 
Understand "z crank", "gold crank", "gold", "z", "crank" as the Z crank.

Instead of turning a Cartesian Crank (called the handle):
[we rotate as many times as specified by the player, or by a random amount. We tell the player which we're doing, and the random one will never go past a correct answer! ]
	let the turn-count be the number of turns to make;
	if the turn-count is 0, let the turn-count be a random number between 1 and 4;
	let n be the coordinate of the model of the handle;
	repeat with turn-number running from 1 to the turn-count:
		if the units part of n is 9:
			decrease n by 0.9;
		otherwise:
			increase n by 0.1;
		if the number of turns to make is 0: [ ie. player didn't specify] 
			if units part of n is 3 or the units part of n is 2 or the units part of n is 5:
				let the turn-count be the turn-number;
				break;
	change the coordinate of the model of the handle to n;
	say "I turn [the handle] clockwise [turn-count times][one of], and the second tumbler of [the meter of the handle] slowly winds on, so it now[or]. [The meter of the handle][stopping] reads [tens part of n][units part of n].";

Instead of turning a Cartesian Crank (called the handle) backwards:
[we rotate as many times as specified by the player, or by a random amount. We tell the player which we're doing, and the random one will never go past the tens column of a correct answer! ]
	let the turn-count be the number of turns to make;
	if the turn-count is 0, let the turn-count be a random number between 1 and 4;
	let n be the coordinate of the model of the handle;
	repeat with turn-number running from 1 to the turn-count:
		if the tens part of n is 9:
			decrease n by 9.0;
		otherwise:
			increase n by 1.0;
		if the number of turns to make is 0: [ ie. player didn't specify] 
			if the tens part of n is 4 or the tens part of n is 1 or the tens part of n is 9:
				let the turn-count be the turn-number;
				break;
	change the coordinate of the model of the handle to n;
	say "I turn [the handle] anticlockwise [turn-count times][one of], and the first tumbler of [the meter of the handle] slowly winds on, so it[or]. [The meter of the handle][stopping] now reads [tens part of n][units part of n].";

Instead of number-setting a Cartesian Crank to:
	try number-setting the meter of the noun to the number understood instead

Instead of number-setting a Cartesian Meter to:
	say "I can't turn the numbers directly, but I could turn the cranks clockwise or anticlockwise.";

Section 4b - Plural objects for cranks and dials

Some group-cranks are privately-named, part of the controls. The printed name is "cranks". Understand "cranks" as the group-cranks. 

Before doing something with the group-cranks:
	if examining, say "Three cranks - steel, brass and gold. They're attached by piston-arms to the X, Y and Z meters in that order." instead;
	say "You'll have to pick a crank: steel, brass, or gold?" instead.

Some group-meters are privately-named, part of the controls. The printed name is "meters". Understand "meters", "dials" as the group-meters. 

Before doing something with the group-meters:
	if examining, say "The dials read [value of X control] (attached to the steel crank), [value of Y control] (attached to the brass crank) and [value of Z control] (attached to the gold crank, which I can't help noticing is a little more securely attached)." instead;
	say "You'll have to pick a dial: X, Y or Z?" instead.

Section 5 - Book Pulling

The iron chain is scenery, in the Cyclical Library. "A long iron chain that leads up to the contraption on the ceiling. I shouldn't say this, but it looks a lot like the toilet flush that Brother Armitage has been designing." 

Understand "links" as the iron chain.

Instead of pulling the chain:
	say "I pull hard on the chain[one of] and very slowly, the mechanism overhead comes to life. The walls themselves start to move! Sections of shelf seem to float upwards, creating gaps that others sidle into. It's like a basket of crabs kicked over in a market; all the books scuttling this way and that. Noisy, though. Shelves collide with thumps and groans and scrapes. The initiates look very annoyed indeed.[paragraph break][or]. Shelves move and glide around the walls of the library with colossal noise! [stopping]Eventually, everything comes to a halt, and a metal plate extends down from a position above my head with a single book in place.";
	abide by the book-pulling rules;

The book-pulling rules are a rulebook.

To decide which indexed text is the library code:
	let x be the coordinate of the X control;
	let y be the coordinate of the Y control;
	let z be the coordinate of the Z control;
	decide on "[the tens part of x][the units part of x][the tens part of y][the units part of y][the tens part of z][the units part of z]";

A book-pulling rule:
	if the letter state of Brother Sa'at is not 1 begin;
		say "The book is nothing I want though, so I release the chain and it disappears back into the stacks." instead;
	end if;

A book-pulling rule when the library code is "431295":
	if the Principia Planetaria has been handled:
		say "The book turns out to be a dummy! Just a block of wood with 'BOOK ON LOAN' painted on the cover. It won't come free; and disappears into the shelf once more." instead;
	otherwise:
		now the player carries the Principia Planetaria;
		say "It's the Principia! I snatch it down and the plate slides back into the shelf." instead;

A book-pulling rule when the library code is "930428" or the library code is "951024":
	[Easter egg based on the serial numbers for releases of Curses!.]
	say "Sadly, it's not the Principia. I release the chain and the book disappears into the stacks. Curses!" instead;

A book-pulling rule:
	say "Sadly, it's not the Principia. I release the chain and the book disappears into the stacks." instead;

Section 5 - Card Catalogue

A card catalogue is in the Cyclical Library. "By the door to the northeast is a card catalogue. That'll be gone as soon as they work out how to do something more useful with one of Reloh's keyboards than just type letters onto paper."

Understand "index", "cards", "catalog", "box of" as the card catalogue.

The description is "It's a box of index cards, filed alphabetically. Easy to use, unlike the contraption that controls the shelves! I just need to look up whatever title I'm after."

Instead of opening the card catalogue:
	say "I could look something up in the catalogue, if I wanted to."

Before researching when in the Cyclical Library:
	try consulting the card catalogue about the topic understood instead.

Instead of consulting the card catalogue about:
	if the topic understood is a topic listed in the table of index cards begin;
		say "[response entry][paragraph break]";
	otherwise;
		say "I don't find that in the catalogue. It might be listed under a different name or it might not be here at all.";
	end if;

Table of index cards
topic		response
"principia"	"I find one, then another, then a third Principia... seems to be a popular name.[if the letter state of Brother Sa'at is 1] Which one was Sa'at after?[end if]"
"planetaria" or "principia planetaria/planeteria" or "saats/sa'ats/saat's/sa'at's book/volume/request/principia" or "astronomy" or "stars" or "planets" or "planetarium" or "planeteria"	"There are a lot of cards labelled 'Principia', but after a while I pick out Newton's [i]Planetaria[r]. The card reads: '[']Principia Planetaria, the apocryphal astronomical writings of St. Isaac Newton.['] Cartesian Call Number (43, 12, 95).' I put it back in the catalogue."
"newton"	"[one of]Nothing: all the cards are indexed by work name, not author. But can I remember the work name? It was the Participant, or the Particular, or something like that.[or]Still nothing. Looks like they haven't improved the system yet, then.[stopping]"

Section 6 - Tome

The gigantic tome is in the Cyclical Library. "On one of the desks, without a reader, sits a gigantic Tome."

The description is "[if uncut]A large volume, fresh from the Gutenberg in the Abbey. I can tell it's new by the freshness of the leather, and smell of burnt ink and the way some of the pages are still uncut – each leaf is printed double and folded over before being stitched in, so the book needs to be sliced open. Whichever monk was reading it probably went off to find a knife.[otherwise]The book is very new and not very evenly cut.[end if]"

Understand "book", "page", "pages", "leaf", "leaves" as the gigantic tome.
Understand "uncut" as the gigantic tome when the tome is uncut.

The tome can be cut open or uncut. The tome is uncut.

Instead of taking the tome:
	say "The book's out for one of the initiates. I've no good reason to steal it from him.";

Instead of opening the tome:
	try reading the tome;

Instead of reading the cut open tome when the knife is on-stage:
	say "‘On the pattern of flora in the water of shallow ponds. Many investigations have been made into this fascinating subject using the latest close-viewing Opticks and the researches of Maxwell and Newton into the properties of lens-glass. However...'[paragraph break]This doesn't read like a church book at all.";

Instead of reading the uncut tome when the knife is on-stage:
	say "The book isn't readable yet because the pages haven't been cut open.";

Instead of reading the tome when the knife is off-stage:
	move the knife to the Cyclical Library;
	say "A knife falls out from inside the book. Presumably the absent-minded monk had been using it as a bookmark [i]before[r] going off to find a paper knife.";

Instead of slicing the uncut tome with the knife:
	now the tome is cut open;
	say "I slit open the pages of the Tome with the knife. What a helpful child I am!";

Section 7 - Knife

A knife is a thing. The description is "A short steel letter-opener, sharp enough to slice through paper but probably not much good for fending off Calvin."

Understand "short", "sharp", "knife" as the knife.
Understand "letter-opener", "letter opener" as the knife when the knife is not a garden-knife.
Understand "gardener's", "gardeners" as the knife when the knife is a garden-knife.

After taking the knife:
	say "I pick up the knife." instead;

Before dropping the knife:
	say "A knife like this might come in useful. If I run into any Figures... or any Drakes...[paragraph break]" instead.

Before putting the knife on something:
	try dropping the knife instead.

Before inserting the knife into something (this is the can't insert knife rule):
	try dropping the knife instead.

Does the player mean slicing with the knife:
	it is likely.

The knife can be a garden-knife. The knife is not a garden-knife.

Rule for printing the description of the garden-knife knife:
	say "A short gardener's knife, sharp enough for slicing bramble-stems but probably not much good for fending off Calvin."

Section 6b - The Tome disappears and the Knife is left behind

[ If the player fails to find the Knife and has finished with the Planteria puzzle so he won't go back, we drop the knife in his view so he can continue the game ! ]

MONK_DROPS_KNIFE is a trigger.

Every turn when the location is the Upper Nave and the knife is off-stage and the knife is not handled and we have provided Sa'at with the book [so we aren't going back to the Library and we don't have the knife ]: 
	fire MONK_DROPS_KNIFE;

Rule for firing unfired MONK_DROPS_KNIFE:
	move the knife to the location;
	remove the gigantic tome from play;
	move backdrop-initiate to the Upper Nave;
	say "A hassled initiate dashes through the Nave, knocking me to one side with the corner of the gigantic Tome he's carrying in both arms. The collision makes something clatter to the floor, but he doesn't see it - and then he's gone."

Understand "clatter", "something", "thing" as the knife when MONK_DROPS_KNIFE is fired and the knife is not handled.

Rule for printing the description of the backdrop-floor when in the Upper Nave and MONK_DROPS_KNIFE is fired and the knife is not handled:
	say "On the floor is a long paper knife."

The backdrop-initiate is a man, scenery, privately-named. Understand "tome", "gigantic", "initiate", "monk", "hassled" as the backdrop-initiate. The printed name is "hassled initiate". Before doing something with the backdrop-initiate, say "The initiate is long gone." instead.

Section 8 - The Principia Planetaria

Understand "book", "tome", "tables", "co-ordinates", "apocrypha", "diagrams", "planeteria" as the Principia Planetaria.

Instead of reading the Principia Planetaria:
	say "Why anyone would want to read this is beyond me. After a hundred pages of numerical tables listing the table-co-ordinates of co-ordinates of stars, there follows a hundred pages of diagrams of the night skies and everything beyond, all joined up by watch escapements, rods, springs, levers and releases. [i]Newton's Clock Universalis[r], it's called. It's like someone sketched the Milky Way and their child doodled all over it. (It's an [i]Apocrypha[r]. I'm pretty sure that means it's rubbish).";

Part 13 - West Clerestory

The West Clerestory is a room, in the Cathedral Space. "[if Archbishop's Meeting has not happened]This balcony has a good view down over the choir stalls and the altar where the monks are still clustered. The sun has just come round and I'm standing, bathed in colourful light from the enormous stained glass window. Spiral stairs lead down, and the balcony curves around to the northeast.[otherwise]This is where the Figure went – and it's not hard to see where he went next either. Part of the west wall has disappeared to reveal a ladder built into a space in the brickwork. No problem, though. I'm [i]good[r] with ladders.[end if]"

Instead of making to leave when in the West Clerestory: try going down instead.
Instead of going inside in the West Clerestory: try going down instead.

Instead of facing west in the west clerestory when the player can see the secret construction ladder:

Chapter 1 - Window of the Lever

The window of the lever is a stained glass window, scenery, in the West Clerestory. "This pane of glass depicts an enormous lever, being operated from very far off by a man wearing a bed-sheet.

Instead of going up in the presence of the secret ladder:
	try climbing the secret ladder;

Instead of going west in the presence of the secret ladder:
	try climbing the secret ladder;

Instead of going inside in the presence of the secret ladder:
	try climbing the secret ladder;

Instead of climbing or entering the secret ladder:
	say "I scurry up the rungs of the ladder. A few squeak and bend but none of them break.[paragraph break]And then I'm out on a narrow ledge, high up near the Cathedral's roof! Mustn't look down!";
	move the player to Among the Gargoyles;

Instead of closing the secret ladder:
	say "I can't see any mechanism for it (the Figure must have been in quite a hurry not to do it himself. So I've scared him, then!)";

Instead of taking the secret ladder:
	say "The ladder is carved into the wall[if the caretaker's ladder is handled]. There's no wandering off with this one[end if]."

After looking in the West Clerestory when Overheard Conversation has ended:
	move the escaping Figure backdrop to all rooms that are the West Clerestory;

Instead of approaching the escaping Figure in West Clerestory:
	try climbing the secret ladder.
	
Chapter 3 - Balcony

The Clerestory-balcony is a privately-named backdrop. It is in the West Clerestory, East Clerestory and North Clerestory. The printed name of the Clerestory-balcony is "balcony". Understand "balcony", "rail", "railing" as the Clerestory-balcony. 

The description of the Clerestory-balcony is "The balcony curves right around the Clerestory."

Instead of climbing or jumping on or jumping off or jumping over or entering the Clerestory-balcony: say "No thanks. I'd rather take the stairs."

	try jumping over the Clerestory-balcony.

Part 14 - North Clerestory

Chapter 1 - Description

The North Clerestory is a room, northeast of the West Clerestory, northwest of the East Clerestory, in the Cathedral Space. "[if Archbishop's Meeting has not happened]To the south the whole cathedral stretches away, all monks and pews and the three Great Seals on the floor. The balcony - which is the only thing to stop me breaking my neck - curves from southwest to southeast.[otherwise]The north end of the cathedral.

Section 1 - Statues

A thing called the statues of St Breguet and St Babbage is plural-named, in the North Clerestory. 
"In one corner stand two enormous statues of St Breguet and St Babbage. They're huddled together like conspirators and Babbage's enormous head gets in the way of the beautiful stained glass behind him."

The description is "[if Archbishop's Meeting has not happened]The statues are twice life-size (probably exactly), and carved down to the tiniest detail. Breguet has fluff on his jacket and Babbage's wig seems to have a few lice. Their enormous faces are turned toward each other, and down, as though they were muttering something about me. In between their feet is a shadowy gap.[otherwise]Between the statues is a pool of deep shadow.[end if]"

The printed name is "statues of St. Breguet and St. Babbage"

I duck behind Babbage's coat-tails to listen.[paragraph break]'I'm not, erm, not happy, no,' Gubbler is saying. 'This isn't right.'[paragraph break]'It's vital. Give me the key,' the Figure replies. The voice is a quiet murmur, like the sound of a mead barrel rolling over flagstones. 'You've got your money.'[paragraph break]'Here.' Gubbler sounds reluctant. 'It's an exact copy of, erm, the one, in the desk. Yes. And there's a guard too, but I'll well – I'll – well. It doesn't do to say.'";

SE_NC_FIGUREEVENT2B is a scripted event. The display text is "'And the final lock?' the Figure demands.[paragraph break]'That's your problem,' Gubbler says, sounding almost like an Abbot for once. 'Nothing to do with me, no, oh no. Look: do you even know your way around this Cathedral?'[paragraph break]'Intimately,' the Figure replies smoothly. 'All six secret doors.'[paragraph break]'Six?' Gubbler demands. His voice is sweating. 'The only one I know is the one from the Choir to the Bishop's Library! Where there's a [i]drill[r] and all... Look. I'm going to, erm, go. Good luck. I hope you get caught.'[paragraph break]With that, the Abbot shuffles away southeast."

The face is nothing but darkness below his hood. His tight leather costume makes him look like a snake. 'You should stop turning up where you aren't wanted,' the Figure advises menacingly. 'You're playing with fire. You are warned.'[paragraph break]Then, in a flash of silver like a fish slipping the bait, the Figure wheels and darts away southwest."

Part 15 - East Clerestory

Chapter 1 - Description

The East Clerestory is a room, in the Cathedral Space. "[if Doric is in North Clerestory]I'm legging it from the watchman, who's only a pace behind. I could jump the rail or take the stairs down - I know which I'd prefer![otherwise if Archbishop's Meeting has not happened]This balcony, which curves to the northwest, is built right above the choir stalls. I could probably jump down onto them if I felt really brave, but it'd be easier to take the stairs, built against the east wall, just below the enormous stained glass window.[otherwise]I'm back on the balcony on the east side of the Cathedral, underneath the gigantic window depicting a winding key. Stairs lead down and the balcony curves away to the northwest.[end if]"

Section 1 - Description

Doric is a man, in the East Clerestory. "[if Doric is awake]There's another door to the north; solid oak. It may not look like much, but judging by the guard in front, that's the Archbishop's door[one of].

I protest.[paragraph break]'Then show the paper what says so,' Doric replies. 'Else you'll be out here feeling important all day.'[otherwise]'Good for you,' he says, without interest.

I ought to chuck you over t' balcony for suggestin' it. But I won't.' He tips his head at the door. 'Boss might hear it. Doesn't like violence inside.' Suddenly he stiffens. 'Less it's necessary, don't think about rushing me neither.'".

CT_DOR_SEAL is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'Do I need this proof of yours sealed or stamped?' I ask." The response text is "'First of all,' Doric answers patiently, 'if you was a proper Abbey type, you'd already know. Second of all, without a seal a piece of paper's just a piece of paper. Third of all, you can't get seals just anywhere so you can get your hopes down already. Got it?'"

CT_DOR_ME is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'Listen, I'm from the Abbey,' I begin, 'and...'". The response text is "'I don't much care if you're from the Moon,' Doric replies smartly.

Part 1 - Bishop's Library

Chapter 1 - Description

The Bishop's Library is a room. "[one of]I'd been expecting something grander than this! Maybe a long sofa, a little more light, perhaps even his own Tea Maker. But instead there's[or]There's[stopping] nothing but a single desk, some books, and a lot of wrought iron decoration – hooks, candle-brackets, ink-wells – all made from a single sweeping line of iron that curls around the floor and walls like a wandering pen-stroke."


Before making to leave when in the Bishop's Library: try going south instead.


Section 1 - The Archbishop

The Archbishop is a man, in the Bishop's Library. "The Archbishop himself sits behind the desk, his face barely visible in the light through the narrow windows."

The description is "He's a nice old man and looks quite fine dressed in his full ceremonial robes. Around his neck he wears a Symbolic Key on a chain – a bit like mine, I suppose. His hands are quietly folded and he's listening – but I don't think he's taking me very seriously."

Understand "bishop", "arch-bishop", "arch bishop", "steelspring" as the Archbishop.

Rule for clarifying the parser's choice of the Archbishop:
	do nothing;

Instead of going through the Bishop's Door from the Bishop's Library:
	say "But I have to convince him! I can't just give up now!";	

The Symbolic Key is carried by the Archbishop. It has description "The Key is long, thin, and set with twelve teeth around its circumference. What it's a key to I don't know. Office, maybe. Anyway, it's more important than the clock key round [i]my[r] neck."


Chapter 2 - Scenery

The Archbishop's desk is a supporter, scenery, in the Bishop's library. The description is "The Archbishop's desk has a single drawer. No doubt what's in that is highly important."
The printed name is "desk".

The single drawer is a container, closed, lockable, locked, part of the Archbishop's Desk. The old iron crypt key is in the single drawer. The old iron crypt key is privately-named. Understand "old/iron/crypt key", "old iron/crypt key", "key", "iron crypt key", "old iron crypt key" as the old iron crypt key. 

Instead of doing something when the single drawer is involved and Return To The Cathedral has not happened:
	redirect the action from the single drawer to the Archbishop's Desk;
	try the current action instead;

Some Archbishop's bookshelves are scenery, in the Bishop's library. The description is "Well, of course he has books. But I didn't come here to read or to rummage around."
The printed name is "books".

Understand "book", "books", "shelf", "shelves", "bookshelf" as the Archbishop's bookshelves.

Instead of doing something when the Archbishop's bookshelves are physically involved:
	say "That won't make him listen to me, will it?";

Chapter 3 - Event on Entry

BISHEVENT1 is a trigger.

Rule for firing unfired BISHEVENT1:
	say "'Well, well!' he remarks, with an unhurried smile. 'I don't remember your name, young one, but I remember your face. Why did they send you? You've not broken something again, I trust?'[paragraph break]For a moment I'm too tongue-tied to speak. It's the Archbishop himself!";

	if the topic understood includes "[calvinanddrake]" begin;
		say "I didn't come all this way – and do all that – just to complain!" instead;
	end if;
	do nothing instead;

[A somewhat vestigial non-scene just so that we can make use of scene-specific conditions such as "if Archbishop's Meeting has happened...". The actual scene logic is handled by scripted events, of course. We could use other, equivalent conditions, perhaps defined as a definition, but this way is at least built into the I7 syntax.]

Archbishop's Meeting is a scene. Archbishop's Meeting begins when the location is the Bishop's Library. Archbishop's Meeting ends when BISHEVENT1 is fired.

When Archbishop's Meeting begins:
	now the statues of St Breguet are scenery;

	[because they get mentioned in the replacement room description.]
	remove DistantDoric from play; [not needed - he's asleep now anyway!]
	move the secret ladder to the West Clerestory;

Rule for printing the description of a stained glass window when Archbishop's Meeting has happened:

They're firmly locked and the only key,' – he pauses, to pat the drawer of his desk – 'Is quite safe. Where only I have it.'[paragraph break]'But...'[paragraph break]'And even if your thief could turn himself into a lizard and slip through the gate,' he continues, 'there's a last lock that only I can pass. And that's without question.' He smiles. 'Well, it's [i]with[r] question, in fact. But never mind that.'"

SE_BISHOP_3 is a scripted event. The display text is "I try once more, but the Archbishop has heard enough. 'I admire your devotion. Especially from such a rough young child. But really, I'm a busy man.' With that he eases me towards the door.[paragraph break]'But...'[paragraph break]'No buts. In all things.' He raises a stern finger. 'Patience is the key.' He giggles. 'It really is, in fact. But remember that. Patience, that's the key. Now off you go.'[paragraph break]And with that, I'm ushered out. This is a disaster!"

Part 5 - Among the Gargoyles


Among the Gargoyles is a room. "Looking down – oh, no... - there's the floor of the choir, far below. I'm really, really high up – higher than my little bedroom – and this ledge is a lot narrower than my bed... And there's nothing to hold onto - nothing out there but space, and the gigantic workings of the Cathedral clock, like a hornet's nest suspended from the centre of the dome."

SE_GARGOYLES2 is a scripted event. The display text is "I spot the Figure, clinging to the clock's gears like a spider. The hood is turned to look back at me. For a moment he's still – then an escapement above him turns and he's scuttled upwards, deep into the turning wheels.".

	[ we're in Amongst the Gargoyles and we've not yet seen him. But we're about to! ]
	do nothing;

Chapter 3 - Pendulum

The cathedral clock penduluum is scenery, in Among the Gargoyles. "The penduluum weight is the size of a Grandfather clock and the rod on which it swings is the size of a tree. If that thing hits me it'd be like Drake stepping on a beetle."

Chapter 3 - Telescope Mechanism

Section 1 - The Telescope Itself

The telescope is a pointer, eyeable, in the Observation Platform. "At the platform's centre is a metal telescope on a tripod that points [way of the telescope]. The tripod has a crank at its base[one of], much like the ones in the library and the one inside the clock's working. There must be a blacksmith somewhere who does nothing but make these cranks. I might be able to see him from here, too, since I've got a perfect view of the whole city[or], and the thing is set up to give a great view of the city[stopping]."

The description of the telescope is "The telescope is made of finely-moulded brass stamped with the crossed lightning of the Weather Guild. [one of]Often accused of non-mechanism – weather's just too temperamental - they tend to build machines that are overly complicated, like the ratchet-and-piston umbrella they sell in the Cathedral Yard market for nine hours a pop. So, the telescope[or]The[stopping] tripod has a crank and compass on the base, which presumably do the business of pointing.[paragraph break]Still, the view must be fantastic. I could look through the telescope to see. (It's currently pointing [way of the telescope])."

Understand "tripod", "mechanism" as the telescope.

The way of the telescope is east.

Instead of turning the telescope:
	say "No good trying to move it by hand. You can't back a gear against a gasket, as they say."

Rule for observing through the telescope when the telescope points west:
	say "The huge clockface of the Cathedral – or a tiny portion of it – fills the eyepiece. [run paragraph on]";

Rule for observing through the telescope when the telescope points northwest or the telescope points southwest:
	say "The Cathedral's spires cut the view of the city beyond. [run paragraph on]";

Rule for observing through the telescope when the telescope points east or the telescope points southeast:
	say "Sunlight sparkles from the flickering surface of the Fugit, running down from the mountains towards the sea, far to the south. [run paragraph on]";

Rule for observing through the telescope when the telescope points northeast:
	say "The Abbey roof looks weathered and beaten this close up. [run paragraph on]";

Rule for observing through the telescope when the telescope points south:
	change balloon spotted to true;
	say "[one of]At first I think it's a fly on the lens, but when it doesn't move away I realise it's the Figure's ornithopter! Flying south, is he? [or]The Figure's ornithopter is clearly visible to the south. [stopping][run paragraph on]";

Balloon spotted is a truth state that varies. Balloon spotted is false.

Last observing through the telescope:
	if balloon spotted is false:
		say "But no sign of the Figure in this direction.";
	otherwise:
		say paragraph break;

Section 2 - Compass

The compass is a pointer, part of the telescope. The description is "The compass is a steel pointer riveted over the engraving of a compass on a brass disc at the telescope's base. Currently the pointer is set to [way of the compass][if the way of the compass is the way of the telescope]; the telescope points the same way[otherwise], while the telescope points [way of the telescope][end if]."

Section 3 - Crank

The large crank is part of the telescope. The description is "The large crank is attached to one leg of the tripod. There's presumably an Archimedes screw inside or something connecting it to the compass and the telescope up top."

Understand "handle" as the large crank.

Instead of turning the large crank when the way of the telescope is the way of the compass:
	say "The crank won't turn. Must be something wrong with the rest of the mechanism[one of].[or]. Something to do with the compass, maybe?[stopping]";

Instead of turning the large crank:
	now the way of the telescope is the way of the compass;
	say "[one of]Am I turning the crank or is the crank turning me? After a few rotations of whichever-it-is, I find I'm on a different side of the tower with both me and telescope facing [way of the telescope].[or]The crank turns and I find myself looking [way of the telescope].[or]This time, I turn the crank and pay attention to what's going on. It's not the telescope turning – it's the whole tower itself. That's the Weather Guild for you. The only thing that doesn't turn is the compass. Now we're pointing [way of the telescope], same as it.[or]The tower rotates so the telescope is now pointing [way of the telescope].[stopping]";

Section 4 - City View

A thing called the op_distant_city_view is scenery, privately-named, in Observation Platform. "The view isn't quite as incredible as from the minute hand of the clock, but I can still see the jumble of buildings, dipping slightly down as it approaches the River Tempus to one side, and the River Fugit on the other." The printed name is "city".

Understand "city", "whole", "river", "rivers", "tempus", "fugit", "building", "buildings" as the op_distant_city_view.

Instead of doing something when the op_distant_city_view is physically involved: say "The city is a lot, lot bigger than I thought it was - and it's a lot, lot bigger than me."

The Weather Station is an exterior room. "[one of]Good Grease! This roof is like a museum of meters! [once only]Thermometers, barometers, precipitometers (these are just glass tubes open to catch the rain) and a zephyrgraph attached to a flight of metal stairs that lead up to a platform to the northwest. I can't see any other way off this roof, although there is a closed hatch underfoot. The wooden plank I used to get here is further off than I thought!"

I'm staying here.[or]The wooden plank is just too far away for me to get to safely.[stopping]" instead.

Instead of doing something with the inaccessible board:
	say "It's too far from the edge of the roof to reach.";

Section 3 - Various meters

Some various meters are scenery, privately-named, in the Weather Station. "Thermometers, barometers, lots of stuff I can't read.

Section 5 - Spigot

The small spigot is a thing, fixed in place, in the Weather Station. "[if weather balloon is inflated]The inflated weather balloon bobs like an eager puppy beside the spigot it's tied to[else]In one corner, a small pipe emerges with a spigot on the end; it's next to (and tied to) a deflated weather balloon[end if]. [If the Weather Station contains the vent]Just above is my length of piping, which is much more impressive: pumping out hot steam and smoke.[end if]"

The description of the small spigot is "A pipe sticks out of the roof and ends in a small spigot. It must be used for filling the balloon. The tap on the spigot is a flat screw-head, set flush with the pipe."

Instead of attacking the small spigot:
	say "That's no way to treat delicate equipment!"

Section 6 - Balloon

The weather balloon is scenery, in the Weather Station. "A small weather balloon. I suppose they use it to lift instruments up into the clouds – but it has a little basket underneath, and I might just be able to squeeze in. The Figure doesn't know what he's let himself in for with me, that's for certain. The balloon is currently [if inflated]full[otherwise]empty[end if], and is tied by a string to the pipe and the spigot."

First for supplying a missing second noun when untying the weather balloon from:
	change the second noun to the small spigot;	

Understand "basket", "string", "rope" as the weather balloon.

Understand "deflated" as the weather balloon when the weather balloon is deflated.
Understand "inflated" as the weather balloon when the weather balloon is inflated.

The weather balloon can be inflated or deflated. The weather balloon is deflated.

Instead of entering the deflated weather balloon:
	say "I try fitting myself into the basket. A squeeze – got to breathe in – but I'll just about go. I get out again, and that's nice too. So I just need to fill it up and I'm off!";

Instead of entering the inflated weather balloon:
	try untying the weather balloon from the small spigot instead;

Before fastening the weather balloon to something when the player's command includes "tie":
	say "The balloon's already tied to the spigot." instead.

Before fastening the weather balloon to the vent:
	try inserting the vent into the weather balloon instead.

Instead of taking the weather balloon:
	say "The basket is bigger than my armspan already, and then there's all the mess of fabric to make the balloon - I can't possibly carry it around. I wouldn't be able to see where I was going!"

Instead of putting the weather balloon on the vent:
	try inserting the vent into the weather balloon;

Instead of putting the weather balloon on the small spigot:
	try inserting the small spigot into the weather balloon;

Instead of filling the weather balloon:
	say "How? You want me to read the Abbey dictates at it until it's had enough hot air?";

Instead of inflating the weather balloon:
	try filling the weather balloon;

Instead of fastening the weather balloon to the small spigot:
	try inserting the small spigot into the weather balloon instead.

Instead of inserting the small spigot into the weather balloon:
	say "There's no gas coming from the spigot.";

Instead of inserting the vent into the inflated weather balloon:
	say "The balloon is already inflated, and ready for take-off!";

Instead of inserting the vent into the deflated weather balloon:
	now the weather balloon is inflated;
	say "Pulling and shoving by turns, I get the mouth of the balloon over to the steam-vent – and then in an instant, it's as light as a feather, easy to handle, bulging a little, bobbing up into the air, and before I know it, it's popped off the vent again and the little balloon is straining on the end of its rope, waiting to be released!";

Ballooning rules is a rulebook.

A ballooning rule when the balloon is deflated:
	say "The balloon's not going anywhere without any gas in it. And if I ever find a way to fill it, I'm going to want it to be tied down!" instead;

A ballooning rule when balloon spotted is false:
	say "[one of]I'm not so sure about that – just shoot up, and hope to catch the Figure by chance? I need to know which way he went and make sure I'm going that way.[or]I'm not just throwing myself to the winds. I want to know which way he went.[stopping]" instead;

A ballooning rule when the way of the zephyrgraph is not south:
	say "The Figure's heading south – the zephyrgraph is pointing [way of the zephyrgraph]. I'd be loosescrew to launch now!" instead;

Rule for supplying a missing second noun when untying the weather balloon from:
	change the second noun to the small spigot;

Instead of untying the weather balloon from the vent:
	try untying the weather balloon from the small spigot instead;

Instead of untying the weather balloon from the weather balloon [we take this to mean "basket" from "balloon" ]:
	say "The basket is pretty firmly connected to the balloon. I don't think I can get them apart."

Instead of slicing the weather balloon with the knife:
	say "I don't see how shredding the balloon is going to help it fly."

Instead of untying the weather balloon from the small spigot:
	abide by the ballooning rules; [i.e. stopping if a test fails]
	say "I untie the rope but leave it looped around the pipe, and keep a tight hold while I squeeze myself into the basket. Then, with a final check of the zephyrgraph I let go. The balloon whisks up into the sky, the basket spinning around and around. The city below a whirl of colours, like a Newtonsday Catherine Cog firework. I'm starting to feel giddy – but I'm making progress. The south wind is behind me like a gale and the dark blot of the ornithopter is closer by the second. In a few moments I'll be alongside, close enough to grab the side of his craft and hang on![paragraph break]The Figure must have seen me. The ornithopter is tilting up - moving higher. Then it drops suddenly. Whirling blades pass by within inches of my face. [i]Tried to get me?[r] I'm thinking. [i]You'll have to try harder than that![r] I catch a glimpse of that shadowy hood behind the controls and then I realise - the Figure wasn't trying to get me. The Figure was trying to shred the balloon.[paragraph break]For a moment, I'm still going up. Then I'm hanging there, perfect equilibrium. And then gravity takes hold. There's nothing for it. I'm falling. I can't cling on to what I'm holding because I'm grasping at the air. The clutter of rooftops rushes closer and closer. [i]You've really done it this time, Wren[r][paragraph break]A smash –[paragraph break]- splintering glass –[paragraph break]- someone thumps me on the back. Drake, here? -[paragraph break]- The wind is knocked from me –[paragraph break]- [i]good stuff, Wren. Just like clockwork.[no line break][r]";
	[ we take the chance to tidy up the player's inventory a bit here ]
	remove Horloge's Keys from play;
	remove the tumbler from play;
	remove the rag from play;
	remove the small gear from play;
	[ ok ]
	end the chapter;
	move the player to the feather bed;

Before approaching or entering the ornithopter when the weather balloon is inflated and the player is in Roofs of the City:
	try approaching the escaping Figure instead.

Before approaching or entering the ornithopter when the weather balloon is deflated and the Weather Station has been visited:
	try approaching the escaping Figure instead.

Before approaching the escaping Figure when the weather balloon is inflated and the player is in Roofs of the City:
	if the player is in the weather balloon:
		try untying the weather balloon from the small spigot instead;
	say "I just need to hop in the balloon and get going!" instead.

Before approaching the escaping Figure when the weather balloon is deflated and the Weather Station has been visited:
	say "I need to find a way of filling that balloon." instead.

Section 6b - Glimpse of weather balloon for navigation

The glimpse of the weather balloon is a glimpse backdrop. It shidentifies the weather balloon. Understand "weather", "balloon" as the glimpse of the weather balloon. "The weather balloon is all ready to go."

Every turn when balloon spotted is true:
	if the location is the Weather Station: [ avoid noun doubling up ]
		remove the glimpse of the weather balloon from play;
	else if the glimpse of the weather balloon is off-stage:
		move the glimpse of the weather balloon to the Roofs of the City.


Section 7 - Zephyrgraph

The zephyrgraph is a pointer, scenery, in the Weather Station. "A zephyrgraph is a small sheet of metal carefully crafted to look like a clock-hand, that's free to turn depending on the wind-direction. (Some people call it a 'weather vane'). It's currently pointing [way of the zephyrgraph]."

Understand "weathervane", "weather vane", "vane" as the zephyrgraph.

The way of the zephyrgraph is southeast.

C_WIND_DIRECTION is a counter. The top end is 4. The internal value is 2;

Every turn when the player can see the zephyrgraph:
	increment C_WIND_DIRECTION;

Rule for firing C_WIND_DIRECTION:
	let the available winds be {south, southeast, east};
	let x be the way of the zephyrgraph;
	remove x from the available winds, if present;
	sort the available winds in random order;
	change the way of the zephyrgraph to entry 1 of the available winds;
	say "[one of]The wind snaps the zephyrgraph round to point [way of the zephyrgraph].[or]The zephyrgraph moves to point [way of the zephyrgraph].[or]The zephyrgraph changes to [the way of the zephyrgraph].[at random]";

After firing C_WIND_DIRECTION:
	change the top end of C_WIND_DIRECTION to a random number from 1 to 3;

Instead of setting or turning the zephyrgraph:
	say "That wouldn't change the weather, but it'd be great it if did."

Instead of direction-setting the zephyrgraph to:
	try turning the zephyrgraph;

Instead of turning the zephyrgraph forwards:
	say "That wouldn't change the weather, but it'd be great it if did."

Instead of turning the zephyrgraph backwards:
	say "That wouldn't change the weather, but it'd be great it if did."

I can barely see the door to the north through all the clutter - [or]This must be the giant's bedroom, where he flings things around, rips them up, and pulls small children apart for fun.

The response text is "'I'm not surprised,' Covalt replies. To my great relief, he lowers the club. 'That's what this Figure was after here, too, before. When I saw him. Come here asking me to build one. I might be the best – and the bravest, I told him – but I can't build a Perpetuum. Laws say, as I read them, that you can't have more than one.'[paragraph break]'But what [i]is[r] it?' I ask. 'What does it do?'[paragraph break]'I've got a design somewhere. A diagram. Shouldn't do, but I do. Somewhere through here. Come on!' He picks me up by the scruff and lobs me through the doorway.".

Laws say, as I read them, you can't have more than one.'[paragraph break]The Perpetuum. Of course, that's what the Figure said.[paragraph break]'But what [i]is[r] it?' I ask.

CT_COV_3_BALLOON is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'I'd pay for the skylight...' I begin.". The response text is "'But you've got less to your name than my cousin K. I see it. Rat.'".

CT_COV_3_ABBEY is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'They never told us about the Perpetuum at the Abbey.'". The response text is "'Not yet, maybe. As secrets go – mysteries – it's a deeper one. Deep in all this junk, too,' he adds, scornfully.".

CT_COV_3_CATHEDRAL is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'I was in the Cathedral earlier,' I tell him. 'I saw the Perpetuum.'". The response text is "'Not much to look at,' he says dismissively. 'Like most of us. It's the workings that count.'".

CT_COV_3_ABBOT is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'I can't believe the Abbot would steal!'". The response text is "'HE must think he knows what he's doing,' Covalt muses. 'Nothing happens at random.'[paragraph break]'Apart from me overhearing this,' I say.[paragraph break]'Aint no chances in that,' he grumbles. 'Nor in my skylight you falling through. Covalt the heretic: we're well matched, you and me.'".

CT_COV_3_FIGURE is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'Who is the Figure?'". The response text is "'No idea,' Covalt says simply. 'Not a tooth of one. Couldn't see his face. But you find me this diagram and I'll show you what he's after.'".

CT_COV_3_ARCHBISHOP is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'I tried to tell the Archbishop.'". The response text is "'Might as well try shouting to a thundercloud,' Covalt says. 'Or turn a rat into a ratchet. I tried to stick him on my new devices. Heretical, he said. So. Some things can't be done.'".

CT_COV_3_COVALT is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'Who are you?'". The response text is "'A clockmaker. An inventory. Aint meant to do both,' he smiles. 'But they're a little too scared to stop me. Besides, I'm the only one who knows how to mend the rose clock up, so, they call me heretic but they need me to keep both thumbs.'".

CT_COV_3_RAVENS is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'Do your ravens have names?'". The response text is "'Course they do. Hugin. Mummin. If that ain't old Celtic for hours and minutes, well, it should be.'".

CT_COV_3_CLOCKWORK is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'How long have you been doing clockwork?'". The response text is "He waves an arm around the room, nearly taking my head with it. 'Takes a lifetime to build up this. I trained in Geneva. To be a monk. Didn't like it. Couldn't see why I couldn't swing clock parts and, well. Sorry.' His thick cheeks turn a little red. 'Maybe you're too young for a full life story.'".

CT_COV_3_SAINTS is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'Who were the Saints?'". The response text is "'People like me,' Covalt says, brazenly. 'Only when they built something new, they weren't heretics they were geniuses. I should show you my new designs. I should. But if I did, I'd have to kill you.' He grins sharply.".

CT_COV_3_SORRY is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'I'm sorry...'". The response text is "'Oh, stop your whimpering,' he scolds. 'Find that diagram so I can show you this Perpetuum.'".

CT_COV_3_PERPETUUM is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'What is the Perpetuum?'". The response text is "'A relic. Of a time they made impossible things. It'll be easier with the diagram, I can't explain anything without a diagram.' Same as Brother Horloge says.".

CT_COV_3_HERESY is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'What were your new designs?'". The response text is "'Well,' he says, pausing to look flattered. 'Mostly voltaics. Wires, filaments. Was thinking about candles, see. Nothing clockwork in a candle, is there?'[paragraph break]I mention the candles on tracks in the Abbey, and he nods.[paragraph break]'See? They've built that [i]because[r] there's no clockwork in candles. Well. I was working on that. Fixing it. But.' He draws a long breath. 'The Church sent me a very nice letter about it and I decided to stop. And you tell them that when you get back, won't you. There's a good sprat.'".

CT_COV_3_DIAGRAM is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'What's this diagram we're looking for?' I ask." The response text is "'Stupid question,' he growls. 'I'll show you when we find it, won't I?'"

CT_COV_3_SHOP is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'So this is your shop?' I ask him." The response text is "'Absolutely. Built it up from good as nothing. Started out mending pocket watches off the back of a crate by the docks. And now...' He shrugs. 'Well, I'm not a lot better off. But I'm better at clocks.'"

Section 3 (continued) - Enquiring about clock shop clutter

After enquiring of Covalt about something:
	carry out the choosing the conversation table activity with Covalt;
	carry out the choosing the conversation topic activity with the noun;
	carry out the speaking with activity with Covalt instead;	

Rule for choosing the conversation topic when we are enquiring of Covalt about something and the state of Covalt is 3:
	change the chosen conversation topic to the conversation corresponding to a hiding place of the second noun in the table of Covalt's Interesting Items;

Table of Covalt's Interesting Items
conversation			hiding place

A clutter topic is a kind of conversation topic. The enquiry text of a clutter topic is usually "[one of]'Tell me about [the second noun],' I ask.[or]'What[if the second noun is plural-named] are these[otherwise][']s this[end if]?' I ask, pointing at [the second noun].[or]'[if the second noun is plural-named]Are they[otherwise]Is that[end if] important?' I ask, nodding at [the second noun].[at random]".

CT_COV_CLUTTER is a clutter topic. The response text is "'I don't need tidy,' he growls. 'Tidy is no good. It'll all go in a box when I do.'".

CT_COV_SHELVES is a clutter topic. The response text is "'Aint enough space,' he grumbles. 'Rent in this city? It's a crime. But you're seen how much space the Cathedral takes up? So think about that when you're learning your Devotions.'".

CT_COV_TABLE is a clutter topic. The response text is "'That's where I does the thinking,' he says. 'Thinking is four-fifths of any clock.' He looks suddenly abashed. 'Though; I does most of my thinking with my fingers, I suppose.'".

CT_COV_CLOCKS is a clutter topic. The response text is "'You aren't surprised, are you?' he demands. 'What do you expect a clockmaker to be stocking? Geese?' He giggles, quite unexpectedly. 'That'd be a [i]cluck[r]maker, surely!'".

CT_COV_WORKBENCH is a clutter topic. The response text is "'Got to work on something,' he grumbles. 'It's a bit less than I'd like, but I make do. Helps,' he adds mysteriously, 'that I'm tall.'".

CT_COV_TOOLS is a clutter topic. The response text is "'I've not got quite the tools I'd like,' Covalts says. 'There are times I need to borrow a few, from down the road. The others. Not that they're happy to lend them. It's cut-throat, I'll tell you. Really is.' He thinks about that for a moment. 'Specially if you aren't careful what you're doing.'".

CT_COV_CLOCKPARTS is a clutter topic. The response text is "'I've a few more of them than I should,' he says. 'I might have left a few out along the way.'".

CT_COV_WATERCLOCK is a clutter topic. The response text is "'Meant to go outside,' he remarks. 'Topped up by rain, see, so it runs for months. Only trouble is the sun dried it up again. Should a built a sundial on top, really, had both working together.' He thinks for a moment and adds, 'Fine unless it snows.'".

CT_COV_BATTERIES is a clutter topic. The response text is "'That?' Covalt grins. 'That you don't know about and you never saw. But I tell you, it's the future. The whole future, in one little package.'".

CT_COV_BIBLE is a clutter topic. The response text is "'Got some good bits,' Covalt remarks. 'Diagrams of escapements, mostly. A nice bit about the design of the One True Cog.'".

CT_COV_PENDULUMS is a clutter topic. The response text is "'They're ordered by length,' he tells me. 'People still order them by mass in some places. Primitives.'".

CT_COV_MONKEY is a clutter topic. The response text is "'I built that for a councillor. Of course, then he turns round and tells me he doesn't really want to pay for it. Cheeky, that's what I think.'".

CT_COV_DEVICE is a clutter topic. The response text is "'That,' and Covalt beams, 'is enough to get my shop shut down. Or burnt down, maybe. Of course, to the Church, it's nothing but sculpture. None of them would know how to turn it on.'".

CT_COV_TOFFEE is a clutter topic. The response text is "'Help yourself.'".

CT_COV_PAPERS is a clutter topic. The response text is "'Don't worry about the order,' Covalt says. 'Mostly, once I've written something down, that means I've learned it enough to not need the paper. I just use that pile to remind me what I've got up here.' And he taps his forehead.".

CT_COV_DOOR is a clutter topic. The response text is "'You want to go, do you? It's not safer out there, I'll tell you that.'".

[These topics may only be fired once.]
Rule for firing a fired conversation topic that is clustered with CT_COV_CLUTTER:
	say "I've already talked to him about that." instead;

Section 4 - When Thinking

Table of thinking Covalt conversation
conversation			topic
CT_COV_4_DIFFERENCE		"difference" or "different" or "difference engine"

Rule for choosing the conversation table of Covalt when the state of Covalt is 4:
	change the chosen conversation table to the table of thinking Covalt conversation;

CT_COV_4_DIFFERENCE is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'What different?' I ask, confused." The response text is "'Of course!' he exclaims, a huge smile cracking his face open like he'd just hit himself with that penduluum of his. 'Sometimes your mouth knows even when your brain don't. And sometimes a machine knows. A knowing machine. [i]The Difference Engine[r]. You heard of it? You should have. Call yourself a monk. We need ourselves the Difference Engine.'[paragraph break]I consider explaining that I'm [i]not[r] a monk, I'm a Second Assistant Clock Polisher, but I let it pass. 'The Difference Engine?'[paragraph break]'Well, first you've got the calculator, right? And the calculator calculates. Give it some numbers, it works out a product. Well, the difference with the Difference is the numbers are ideas. Ideas are messages, and messages can be written as big numbers. So you take two ideas. Two numbers. One's an Actor, you see, the other's an Action. Then you whack [']em into a Difference Engine, and work out what they make.' He shakes his head with pleasure, like he's trying to dislodge that grin of his. 'Great bit of clockwork. About the size of four elephants and no part in it bigger than a woodlouse. That's [i]real[r] clockwork. That is.'"

After choosing the conversation topic when the player can see Covalt and the state of Covalt is 4:
	unless the chosen conversation topic is CT_COV_4_DIFFERENCE:
		change the chosen conversation topic to CT_COV_4_THINKING;

After firing CT_COV_4_DIFFERENCE:
	change the state of Covalt to 5;

CT_COV_4_THINKING is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "[one of]'I...'[or]'But...'[or]'Maybe...'[or]'And...'[or]'Yes...'[or]'Where...'[or]'What...'[or]I swallow.[at random]". The response text is "[one of]He interrupts your question. 'Look, we need to work all this through. There's variables here. Levers left and right. We need to work out what's next to see what we do next. Something [i]different[r] needs to be done.'[or]'Problem solving,' Covalt interjects. 'Is clockwork, too. A [i]different[r] kind of clockwork, but still clockwork.'[or]'What's the [i]difference[r]?' he remarks to himself, not listening to me. 'That's the question.'[or][fire CT_COV_4_DIFFERENCE][paragraph break][stopping]"

Rule for firing CT_COV_4_DIFFERENCE while firing CT_COV_4_THINKING or firing COVALT_COUNTER:
	[we don't want to print the enquiry text in these situations] 
	say the response text of CT_COV_4_DIFFERENCE;
	say run paragraph on;

After firing unfired CT_COV_4_DIFFERENCE:
	add SE_COV_COUNTING_HOUSE to the current script;

SE_COV_COUNTING_HOUSE is a scripted event. The display text is "'Now,' Covalt continues. 'With your Church ways and rags and all, you might get in the Counting House all right. That's where they keep it. The Engine. Here. I'll give you the address. You can read, can't you?' I nod. In reply he produces, from nowhere I can see, a scrap of paper and a quill, and he scratches down an address. He presses it into my hand. 'That's the place. Now. [i]Skidaddle[r].'".

After firing SE_COV_COUNTING_HOUSE:
	now the player carries the scrap of paper;

The scrap of paper is a thing. The description of the scrap of paper is "'The Counting House'. Below – an address. Thriftsteal street. Government quarter."

Understand "address" as the scrap of paper.

Instead of attacking or eating or dropping the scrap of paper when the Grand Foyer is not visited:
	say "Don't. I might need it, in case my memory springs a sprocket."

Rule for choosing the conversation table of Covalt when the state of Covalt is 5:
	change the chosen conversation table to the table of enthusiastic Covalt conversation;

CT_COV_5_MYSELF is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'So what should I do now?' I ask.". The response text is "'Go and find out,' he replies, cheerfully.".

CT_COV_5_DIFFERENCEENGINE is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'I don't understand about this Engine.'". The response text is "'Of course you don't. Clockwork and High Mathematik all in one. It's like understanding being on fire when you're drowning underwater.' He grimaces. 'St. Babbage – he was a genius. That's how it works. But it's for what it does – that's what you're needing it for. So how doesn't really matter.'".

CT_COV_5_ABBEY is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'Maybe I should go back to the Abbey?'". The response text is "'If you've got any sense you'll stay out of there for the next twenty years at least,' Covalt says. 'No place of a mind, working chores and all that copying out.'".

CT_COV_5_CATHEDRAL is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'What about guarding the Cathedral?'". The response text is "'Design before you do,' Covalt growls. 'No point rushing in and standing around. That won't bring your Uncle back to life, as they say.'".

CT_COV_5_ABBOT is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'I think the Abbot was scared,' I say.". The response text is "'Should be,' Covalt smiles, 'with you on his heels. Taking to the air in a balloon! Mad as a monkey-wrench!'".

CT_COV_5_FIGURE is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'How will I catch the Figure? He's faster – and probably smarter, too...'". The response text is "'Like I've told you. Like this Difference Engine will tell you. Time for some decent advising, that's what it is. Right now, if you look at it, you've got nothing but my demented ramblings and your own half-baked ideas,' – he holds up a palm – 'no offence, but you're shorter than my navel so you can't be that well-read. So.' He shrugs.".

CT_COV_5_ARCHBISHOP is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'Shouldn't we warn the Archibishop?'". The response text is "'You did already,' he says, impatiently. 'Anyway, if we start trying to do things the Church way we'll be going round and round a clockface when we should be going up in the air.' He grins, suddenly. 'I meant that as a figure of speech, but I guess that's what you did, there, in your balloon. So fancy that.'".

CT_COV_5_PEOPLE is a conversation topic. The response text is "He won't know them.".

CT_COV_5_COVALT is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'What will you do?'". The response text is "'Me? Keep my head down and fix my skylight. There's nothing else for me to do. I'm not having me suspected of theft, heresy is quite a charge enough.'".

CT_COV_5_RAVENS is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'I like your ravens.'". The response text is "'Well, they must like you,' he replies, 'or they'd have had your eyes out by now.'".

CT_COV_5_CLOCKWORK is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'So you know all about clockwork, then.'". The response text is "'My fingers know.' He waves one. It's about the size of a small dog. 'I'm a doer, not so much a thinker. I find things out instead of dreaming them up. That's my way. Half-bothered.'".

CT_COV_5_SAINTS is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'You know about the Saints?'". The response text is "'Inventors, designers. Good, mind. Very good. But morality, well, there's another thing. I don't know such.' He lowers his voice. 'I got my doubts on Babbage, say. And Newton? They say he lost it once his fame got out and it wound up with him locked in a cell somewhere, raving loony.' He winks. 'But don't tell ‘em I told you when you tell the other sprats, eh?'".

CT_COV_5_SORRY is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'I'm sorry about dragging you into this,' I tell him.". The response text is "'Not a grit-grime, don't worry. I'm dragging myself straight back out again the second you leave.'".

CT_COV_5_PERPETUUM is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'Is the Perpetuum important?'". The response text is "'Well,' and he scratches his chin with a noise like a cart over cobbles. 'Depends. Thing is, that right now, it isn't any use. Just for looking at. Powers itself and nothing else. I think that's right. The universe does its grind and the Perpetuum does it other. Or maybe they're related.' He shakes his head. 'I don't know. I get fuzzy about Book VIII of Euclid, you don't want to be asking me.'".

CT_COV_5_ADDRESS is a conversation topic. The enquiry text is "'How do I get to this Counting House?' I ask." The response text is "'That's easy,' he replies - then rattles off a long list of directions I don't remember at all. But I nod and pretend to listen anyway - exactly as though I was back in the Abbey."

Chapter 1 - Description

The Clock Shop is north of Covalt's Bedroom. "[if the state of Covalt is at least 4]The afternoon sunlight comes in from the door to the street, casting shadows across the junk-piles and scrap.[else][one of]The first thing I see is the door onto the street, southwest. Escape! But there's nothing to escape from - Covalt is just a clockmaker and this is his workshop: a tiny room stuffed with springs and rods and pistons, the workbench and shelves and floor almost invisible under a layer of brass teeth and penduluums.[or]When I say I'm in Covalt's shop I'm mean I'm [i]in[r] it, knee-deep. It's everywhere. It's got more bits than one of Cook's soups, and there's not a scrap of space that isn't filled with clutter. It'd be like standing inside an intricate mechanism - if there was any Good Order or Precision at all, which there isn't. Somewhere in this mess is a table, and the door to the street is southwest, but even that's hung with a rack of shelves.[stopping][end if]"

Instead of making to leave in the Clock Shop: try going southwest.

His voice has taken on a deep, reverent quality, more solemn and rich than the crackly old Abbot ever manages in any of his sermons. It's like the page itself was radiating the light of moving gear-teeth, throwing sparkles into Covalt's eyes.[paragraph break]'Drawing it came after,' Covalt continues. 'Babbage, they say, just sat down and made the machine. Cog-only knows how. Can't stop, you see. Can't start. Must have been running [i]while[r] he was putting it together. The Perpetuum is self-winding. Runs and runs without stopping. Forever. Look,' and he points to parts of the diagram. Cogs attached to other cogs that attach back to themselves. 'No spring at all,' Covalt says, wistfully. 'Nowhere for a spring to even [i]go[r]. A universe in miniature, all of its lonesome, so the books tell it. Got to keep it separate, and all is well. But your Figure, if he gets one. Well, I don't know.'[paragraph break]'What do you think the Figure wants with it?' I ask.[paragraph break]'Batters me. I don't know. I wondered that ever since he turned up asking me to build one – like I even [i]could[r] build one. I mean, this diagram, isn't a [i]full[r] diagram. It's like an aspect of the Perpetuum. Like, if you shone a light at the machine and sketched the outline of the shadow. Good for the soul of a clockworker, but your Figure? I guess he wants it [']dapted. For something else. Something quite else...' He trails off, quite suddenly, lost in thought.";

The description is "It's really a series of diagrams: the first, the rack for the ball-bearing just like I saw in the Cathedral. But below, well, then it gets [i]really[r] complicated. Cogs forming snake-like chains across several levels, all intersecting and then re-intersecting with themselves. It looks like, if it wasn't running, it'd be locked up solid and tight. But [i]because[r] it's running, there's always a gap for the next tooth to take." Understand "plan/diagram/blueprint", "perpetum", "diagram/ of" as the Perpetuum Mobile diagram.

After printing the description of the Perpetuum Mobile diagram when the player can see Covalt during Covalt's Shop Hunt:

Rule for firing the anxiety counter when Calculatrix Chase is not happening:
	say "[one of]People are talking quietly in the offices on either side.[or]Somewhere nearby, a floorboard creaks.[or]Someone approaches from down the corridor. I throw myself into a doorway until they're safely past.[or]From behind one of the doors I can hear voices, deep in conversation.[or]A door-handle turns. I freeze! But then the handle relaxes again and footfalls move away from the door.[or]If each room has just one person in it, that means at least forty ways I could get caught, and eighty pairs of feet…[or]If it weren’t for the carpet in this place my footsteps would have alerted everyone here by now![or]If only the doors had glass panels. Then at least I’d get some warning![cycling]";

Which is why I've got my fingertips hooked through the grille to the [west with mirroring].[paragraph break]There is a ladder for going down to ground level from here. And looking across the open space of the Counting House, I can see – of course – another identical balcony on the other side."

Chapter 3 - Script

SE_BALCONY_1 is a scripted event. The display text is "In the middle of the machine below is a wide circular platform, on which two women are in deep discussion, their voices echoing through the domed hall.[paragraph break]'Any idea? Any at all?' the tall woman is asking.[paragraph break]'Five digits,' replies the other, smaller woman, before she pauses to push a pair of spectacles back up her nose. 'Five and five. All questions have an actor and an action, and each is a five digit number. Then it's a sort of sum we do...'[paragraph break]'How divine!' remarks the tall woman.[paragraph break]'Quite,' the other replies.".

SE_BALCONY_2 is a scripted event. The display text is "The shorter woman is indicating an elaborate steel abacus by her elbow. 'The numbers are entered here, and over on the other side. St. Babbage's original was free to be used by everyone but of course, once the Government sequestered the machine...'[paragraph break]'You have a copy of the key?' the tall woman demands. Her face is familiar from somewhere, but I can't place it.[paragraph break]'Of course I do!' The shorter woman laughs, and lifts up a key on a ribbon around her neck. It is made of a brilliant red material that sparkles in the light. 'How else could I compute your answers?'[paragraph break]'Calculatrix Pristina,' the tall woman asks, very seriously. 'Did it answer my three questions? Was it capable?'".

SE_BALCONY_3 is a scripted event. The display text is "The Calculatrix below is nodding. 'It can answer any question, even questions so very...' She shifts, awkwardly. '[i]Incompatible[r].'[paragraph break]'Never mind that,' the tall woman replies fiercely. That's when I place her: the Duchess du Mer, the only woman in Parliament, who gained the place after her husband disappeared along with his boat on the Spanish Main. She's visited the Abbot before and always seemed quite kind. [paragraph break]'All I'm trying to explain,' the Calculatrix replies, voice shaking, 'is that this -' a whisper - 'Relativity' - she blushes - 'is hard to describe in clockwork. And the machine's answers may only be the projection of the truth through the space of the Engine.'[paragraph break]The Duchess is waving a handful of small cards. 'All I want is a yes or no,' the Duchess replies. 'Are these answers reliable?'[paragraph break]'True, yes,' the Calculatrix answers. She looks distinctly uncomfortable. 'But reliable? Well, relatively, perhaps...'[paragraph break]The two women walk away towards the glass doors, still in conversation.".

SE_BALCONY_1 is clustered with SE_BALCONY_2 and SE_BALCONY_3.

Part 13 - In The Engine

Engine Room is north of Main Platform. The printed name is "In The Engine". West of The Engine Room is down of the Western Balcony. East of The Engine Room is down of Eastern Balcony.

The description is "[one of]I'm standing in the middle of the engine: it's like being a giant in a pine forest. All around are straight brass strands with cogs for branches and tiny teeth for needles that brush against those of their neighbours. It's all moving, all the time, stirred by a breeze – shivers start from the main platform to the south and across to the ladders east and west.[or]The machine around me moves and breathes quietly, just ticking over, cogs and stands twitching in their sleep. There's something eerie about it - and knowing this is the machine that runs the city, and maybe more... The central platform is just south of here. Two thin ladders climb the dome east and west.[stopping]"

Rule for printing the description of the Engine Room during Calculatrix Chase:
	say "The engine rises up on all sides, hopefully giving me a bit of cover from the guards on the platform. East and west the ladders rise up. Which is great: I've got [i]options[r].";

	say "The Engine is a dizzying sight - the whole of the domed expanse filled with cogs and spindles and spines. This is the heart of the city, right here, or more likely it's brains. I could stare for hours - parts inside parts inside parts... Enough to make one fall and not notice till you hit one of those sharp stacks of cogwheels.";

Rule for printing the description of the inactive Difference Engine:
	say "The Engine is made of blocks, each a thicket of spindles lined with a stack of cogs, able to turn together or independently. A single breath of movement flits around the machine from one cog to another like there was a bee trapped in the workings: one moment by my feet and suddenly back over at the platform[if Calculatrix Chase has not happened]. [paragraph break]And if Covalt thinks this machine can tell me where I can find the Figure in Grey, then I guess it can[end if].";

Rule for printing the description of the Difference Engine:
	say "The machine is moving like a corn-field in a thunderstorm. It seems like every cog is turning, and each spine is clunking up and down, changing the way they interlaced. It's like the mechanism could shake itself loose at any minute. I don't want to be standing in the middle when it does.";

Before attacking or switching off the difference Engine:
	say "Interesting idea. I could just move a couple of switches and then no-one would ever be able to fix it. Then they could never use it to track me down for what I'm doing now... but, if I did, how would I find out where the Figure was heading?" instead.

Before attacking the difference Engine when Calculatrix Chase is happening:
	say "No time for that now! Run!" instead.

Part 14 - Main Platform

Chapter 1 - Description

The Main Platform is a room. "The main platform rises up from the heart of the Engine and is topped by a single lever, large enough to topple a building or lift a ship from the water. Beside it is a dull grey pedestal with something like Brother Reloh’s typewriter on top. Beside it is a dull grey box full of dull grey pamphlets.[paragraph break]To east and west thin catwalks lead towards panels fitted with controls.

Instead of pulling the clutch when all the difference-engine models are correctly set:
	now the Difference Engine is active;
	say "With all the strength I've got left after rooftops and giant bell-towers and ladders and all the rest, I heave back on the lever. Things begin to turn. The platform drops a little lower. Cogs and spindles on all sides start to whip up into a frenzy, the movement spreading across all around the room. It's like kicking over an ant hill.[paragraph break]And then the noise begins.";

Instead of pulling the clutch:
	say "I ought to get some idea of how this machine works before I turn it on.";

Rule for printing the description of the Duchess when the location is the Grand Foyer:
	say "I can't see a lot through the bubbled glass, but the tall lady seems to be leaning over the shorter one as if telling her off.";

Rule for printing the name of the unknown Duchess Du Mer:
	say "tall [if the location is the Foyer]figure[otherwise]woman[end if]";

Instead of doing something when the Duchess Du Mer is physically involved:

Rule for printing the description of the grey pamphlet:
	say "'A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE ESSENTIAL NUMERICALS OF ST GODEL.'[paragraph break]It’s a practical handout, presumably for using the machine. None of it makes any sense: 'quintessential numerics', 'adjusted methodologies', 'truth-state deterministic modifiers'. However, at the bottom in larger letters is a table labeled BASIC. Like the Commandments printed on the back of an Abbey Moral Text, this is the bit people actually use. It reads:[paragraph break]";
	say the table of pamphlet actor words laid out as a grid, paragraph break;

Chapter 1 - Description

The Eastern Platform is a major mirror-room, east of the Main Platform. The hemisphere is east. The printed name is "East Platform". The Eastern Platform mirrors the Western Platform.

Instead of making to leave when in the  Eastern Platform: try going west.
Instead of going inside when in the  Eastern Platform: try going west.


The first description is "This is a small platform to the [west with mirroring] of the central dais. It surrounded on most sides by a brass rail, hooked onto which is a steel abacus that in turn is connected to the Engine by delicate silver chains like the spider-webs of my room after the rain has got in.[paragraph break]Hanging above the platform is a large wooden signboard[if the model-at-hand is not phrase-viewed].[else][board display][end if]"

To decide which difference-engine model is the model-at-hand:
	decide on the viewed model of a random visible display board.

The second description is "This platform is the mirror-image of the one to the [east with mirroring], except that the words on the painted signboard above the abacus are different[if the model-at-hand is not phrase-viewed].[else][board display][end if]"

To say board display:
	let m be the model-at-hand;
	say ": [i]'[stored meaning of m]'[if m is not the action-model]. [end if][r]";


Chapter 2 - Action Display

The action display is a display board, scenery, in the Eastern Platform. The viewed model of the action display is the action-model.

Chapter 3 - Action Control

An abacus called the action-control is scenery, in the Eastern Platform. 

There is a difference-engine model called the action-model.
The controlled model of the action-control is the action-model.

The stored value of the action-model is 32149;
The stored meaning of the action-model is "How much cost today immortality?";
The word-table of the action-model is the table of action words.

[ for actions we accept:
	first - 7			- where
	second - 8, 4, 9 - wicked, in St Phillip, lost
	third - 3, 5 - is planning, chose
	fourth - 2, 4 - to go, today
	fifth - 3, 5 - next, ambition
or

Where in St. Phillip live today property
Where in St. Phillip is planning to steal property
Where wicked is planning to steal property
	first - 7 - where
	second - 4, 8 - wicked, in St Phillip
	third - 3, 9 - is planning, live
	fourth - 3 - to steal
	fifth - 7 - property
]

To decide what number is the action test score for (n - a number):
[ complicated, because we accept two questions "where's the figure going?" and "how will he steal..."? ]
	let first-test-score be 0;
	let test-score be 0;
	let init-n be n;
	assert that n is at least 11111 and n is at most 99999 issuing "Difference engine value out of range.";
	repeat with i running from 1 to 5:
		let l be the remainder after dividing n by 10;
		[l is now the least significant digit of n]
		if i is: 
			-- 5: 
				if l is 7, increase first-test-score by 1;
			-- 4:
				if l is 8 or l is 4 or l is 9, increase first-test-score by 1;
			-- 3: 
				if l is 3 or l is 5, increase first-test-score by 1;
			-- 2: 
				if l is 2 or l is 4 or l is 5, increase first-test-score by 1;
			-- 1: 
				if l is 3 or l is 5, increase first-test-score by 1;
		let n be n minus l;
		let n be n divided by 10; [ -- hence dropping the final digit from n]
	let n be init-n;
	repeat with i running from 1 to 5:
		let l be the remainder after dividing n by 10;
		[l is now the least significant digit of n]
		if i is: 
			-- 5: 
				if l is 7, increase test-score by 1;
			-- 4:
				if l is 8 or l is 4, increase test-score by 1;
			-- 3: 
				if l is 3 or l is 9, increase test-score by 1;
			-- 2: 
				if l is 3, increase test-score by 1;
			-- 1: 
				if l is 7, increase test-score by 1;
		let n be n minus l;
		let n be n divided by 10; [ -- hence dropping the final digit from n]
	if the first-test-score is greater than the test-score, decide on the first-test-score;
	decide on test-score.

A correctness appraisal rule for the action-model:
[	if the stored value of the action-model is 78325 or the stored value of the action-model is 78525:]
	if the action test score for the stored value of the action-model is 5:
		say "My heart skips a beat. [i]It’s my question[r].";
		rule succeeds;

The last correctness appraisal rule for the action-model:
	let l be the action test score for the stored value of the action-model;
	if l is at most 1:
		say "[one of]Of course, I'm meant to be asking about the Figure's plans.[or]Of course, I'm meant to be trying to track down the Figure.[cycling]";
	else if l is at most 3:
		say "But [one of]I can feel I'm close to knowing where to look for the Figure, but I'm not quite there[or]I don't need a machine to tell me this isn't the quite question Covalt wanted me to ask[or]I want to know where the Figure in Grey is going in his ornithopter, and I know this isn't quite going to help with that[or]it doesn't quite feel right[at random].";
	else if l is 4:
		say "That seems very close - but not quite it!";

An unlocking rule for an abacus:
	say "I’d need some kind of key, surely." instead;

Part 16 - Western Platform

Chapter 1 - Description

The Western Platform is a mirror-room, west of the Main Platform. The printed name is "West Platform". 

Instead of making to leave when in the Western Platform: try going east.
Instead of going inside when in the  Western Platform: try going east.


Chapter 2 - Actor Display

The actor-display is a display board, scenery, in the Western Platform. The viewed model of the actor-display is the actor-model.

Chapter 3 - Actor Control

An abacus called the actor-control is scenery, in the Western Platform. 

There is a difference-engine model called the actor-model.
The controlled model of the actor-control is the actor-model.

The stored value of the actor-model is 16233.
The stored meaning of the actor-model is "Powerful woman royal soaring honest".
The word-table of the actor-model is the table of actor words.

To decide what number is the actor test score for (n - a number):
	let test-score be 0;
	assert that n is at least 11111 and n is at most 99999 issuing "Difference engine value out of range.";
	repeat with i running from 1 to 5:
		let l be the remainder after dividing n by 10;
		[l is now the least significant digit of n]
		if i is: 
			-- 5: 
				if l is 1 or l is 6 or [despite the fact the figure is not a man] l is 5, increase test-score by 1;
			-- 4: 
				if l is 1 or l is 4, increase test-score by 1;
			-- 3: 
				if l is 9 or l is 3, increase test-score by 1;
			-- 2:
				if l is 3, increase test-score by 1;
			-- 1: 
				if l is 6, increase test-score by 1;
		let n be n minus l;
		let n be n divided by 10; [ -- hence dropping the final digit from n]
	decide on test-score.

A correctness appraisal rule for the actor-model:
	if the actor test score for the stored value of the actor-model is 5:
[	if the stored value of the actor-model is 14936 or the stored value of the actor-model is 14966:]
		say "I step back and take a look. Well, it’s not great. But it’s probably as close as I’m going to get.";
		rule succeeds;

Instead of abacus-setting the actor-control to when the actor-model is correctly set:
	say "What I've got isn't not great, maybe, but it’s probably as close as I’m going to manage.";

The last correctness appraisal rule for the actor-model:
	let l be the actor test score for the stored value of the actor-model;
	if l is at most 1:
		say "[one of]Of course, I'm meant to be asking about the Figure.[or]Of course, I'm meant to be trying to track down the Figure.[cycling]";
	else if l is at most 3:
		say "But [one of]I can feel I'm close to asking about the Figure[or]I don't need a machine to tell me this isn't going to find the Figure[or]last time I saw the Figure he was in his balloon - but I need to tell the machine that[or]this doesn't quite feel right[at random].";
	else if l is 4:
		say "That seems very close - but not quite right!";

After going through the office window:
	say "No need to ask twice.[paragraph break]I swing my legs up onto the sill and then I’m over and out – yuk! – straight into a pile of rotting garbage. Something crawls out over my leg but I’m smart and I don’t scream, which means the guards overhead stick their heads out and then disappear again.[paragraph break]Then I’m up, brushing myself down and – once I’m two streets away – taking a deep breath. I might have survived all that but the card in my hand is only going to send me somewhere else. And if I’m following the Figure, things could get pretty hairy pretty fast.[paragraph break]The card, in a neat cog-calligraphic hand underneath the punched-out holes reads: [i]462 Old Place, DOCKLANDS[r]. Not the nicest part of the city. But I’ve got to stop the Figure stealing the Perpetuum before it’s too late. And that’ll be soon.[paragraph break]Thing about time is, it [i]always[r] is. So right now it’s time to get moving!";

At least no-one pays any notice: the streets are full of urchins like me, dressed in rags like mine, sitting on street-corners collecting pennies for gear-shine and sharpening. I wonder if they ever get to eat.[paragraph break]I never realised how large the docks of the city were: but then if all the steel in St Philip comes in by boat I suppose it'd need to be like this, a whole city of boards and containers sticking out into the river. I've no idea where 462 Old Place is but then, if I wasn't going to find it the Difference Engine would have told me to give up. So I follow my nose to where the smell gets worse.[paragraph break]Old Place. There aren't any other kids here at all, only older children who look haggard and ghostly. I wish my clothes were more ragged – I'm walking with my arms crossed over the Abbey seal. To be caught here by anybody would be a fate worse than anything Calvin and Drake might deal out.";

A warehouse pipe is a kind of thing. A warehouse pipe is usually scenery, privately-named. The printed name of a  warehouse pipe is usually "pipe". Understand  "fat", "pipe" as a warehouse pipe.

Before entering a warehouse pipe:
	say "That'd be a dangerous place to stand." instead.

Instead of jumping when the location contains a warehouse pipe:

	if the long ladder is not handled and the location is the Loading Bay:
		say " - but the ladder sticking out of the pile of debris might help";
	say "."

The north pipe is a warehouse pipe, in the Loading Bay. "[if the player is atop the ladder]The pipe sticks out of the wall just level with the top of the ladder[otherwise]The pipe's a fair few feet up the wall[end if]. What it's for is anyone's guess."

	unless the long ladder is placed and the long ladder is in the location:
		unless we are putting the long ladder against the second noun or we are fastening a rope segment to the second noun or we are untying a rope segment from the second noun:
			if we are putting a rope segment on the second noun:
				say "[one of]I toss the end of the rope up towards the pipe, but don't even get close.[or]I lob the rope again, but it's too heavy to get anywhere near the pipe.[or]I can't do it from down here - it's too far![stopping]" instead;
			say "The pipe's out of my reach." instead;

Section 4c - Non-interactions

Before entering or jumping on or climbing a warehouse pipe:
	say "I could probably scramble around on the pipes if I had a death-wish, except they don't go anywhere, just straight from one side of the warehouse to the other." instead.

Before looking under or searching a warehouse pipe:

Section 6 - Crate

An enormous packing crate is scenery, in the Loading Bay. "An enormous packing crate. Whatever’s inside must be important because its wrapped around with iron security chains, almost like they were afraid of whatever’s inside breaking out[if the north end of the rope is tied to the packing crate]. The rope is tied to the crate[end if]."

Understand "huge", "thick", "chains", "chain", "iron chain/chains", "security", "iron security chain/chains" as the enormous packing crate.

Rule for printing the description of the enormous packing crate when the warehouse door is open:
	say "The crate has dropped into the drain, blocking my way out!";

Before wrapping the packing crate with a rope segment:
	try fastening the second noun to the noun instead.

Instead of pushing the packing crate:
	try pushing the noun to north. [ helping hand! ] 

Rule for supplying a missing second noun when pushing the packing crate to:
	say "Where should I push the crate?";

Understand "push [enormous packing crate] down/into/through/in/to [air pocket]" as pushing it to. [Not a totally smart thing to do - i.e. the parser never normally generates such a command - but good enough for what we need]
Understand "push [enormous packing crate] down/through/in/to through/into/in/to [air pocket]" as pushing it to. [e.g. > push crate down into drain]
[ Understand "push [enormous packing crate] down/through in to [air pocket]" as pushing it to. [probable overkill] ]

	assert that the north end of the rope is tied to the enormous crate issuing "Rope is tied to crate.";
	assert that exactly two rope segments are coiled issuing "Two rope segments coiled.";
	say "Putting my shoulderblades to the side of the crate and digging my heels into the floorboards, I manage to move the crate a tiny inch towards the drain. Every inch after that is easier as more and more of the crate is out of contact with the floor, until suddenly it’s moving and I nearly fall backwards with it.[paragraph break]The crate tumbles away into the drain. The rope goes taut. And across the hall there’s the sound of moving metal...";
	now the warehouse door is open;

Section 7 - Rope

A rope segment is a kind of thing.

Interconnection relates one rope segment to another (called the other end). The verb to be terminated at implies the interconnection relation. 

Attachment relates one thing (called the anchor) to one rope segment. The verb to be tied to implies the reversed attachment relation.

A rope segment can be coiled. A rope segment is usually not coiled.

Definition: a rope segment (called the segment) is anchored:
	if the anchor of the segment is nothing, no;
	yes;

Definition: a rope segment (called the segment) is unanchored:
	unless the segment is anchored, yes;
	no;

Definition: a thing is suspended:
	if a rope segment is tied to it, yes;
	no;

Definition: a thing is unsuspended:
	unless it is suspended, yes;
	no;

To decide which rope segment is the rope nearby:
	if the location is the Loading Bay:
		decide on the north end of the rope;
	otherwise if the location is the Storage Bay:
		decide on the south end of the rope;

The north end of the rope is a rope segment, privately-named, in the Loading Bay. 

Rule for printing the description of the north end of the rope:
	say "An enormous coil of rope, maybe enough to cross the Thymes and back."

Understand "rope", "end", "end of", "end of the" as the north end of the rope. The printed name of the north end of the rope is "rope".

Rule for printing the name of the rope while taking inventory:
	say "part of the rope";

Section 6.0 - Printing Rope

Rule for printing the description of a rope segment (called the segment):
	say "An enormous coil of rope, maybe enough to cross the Thymes and back. ";
	unless the noun is held:
		say the room description details of the segment;
	otherwise:
		say paragraph break;

Rule for writing a paragraph about a rope segment (called the segment):
	if the middle of the rope is held:
		say "I'm holding ";
		if the segment is tied to nothing or the other end of the segment is off-stage:
			say "one end ";
		otherwise:
			say "the middle ";
		[end if]
		say "of a long rope. ";
	otherwise:
		say "There's a length of rope [if the player is atop the ladder]on the floor [end if]here. ";
	[end if]
	say the room description details of the segment;

To say the room description details of (the segment - a rope segment):
	say "It";
	if the segment is tied to something (called the anchor):
		say "'s tied to [the anchor] and";
	if the segment is coiled:
		say " is looped over a pipe near the ceiling and";
	if the middle of the rope is not held and the other end of the segment is off-stage and the segment is unanchored and the segment is not coiled:
		say " is coiled up in loops and";
	[end if]
	if the other end of the segment is on-stage:
		if the segment is coiled:
			if the other end of the segment is coiled:
				say " passes over the second pipe to the [if the segment is the north end of the rope]south[otherwise]north[end if]. It";
			else:
				say " slopes down to the [if the segment is the north end of the rope]south[otherwise]north[end if] at a sharp angle. It";
		else if the other end of the segment is coiled:
			say " disappears to the [if the segment is the north end of the rope]south[otherwise]north[end if] at a sharp angle up towards the roof. It";
		otherwise:
			say " snakes away to the [if the segment is the north end of the rope]south[otherwise]north[end if]. It";
		[end if]
	[end if]
	if the other end of the segment is tied to something and the segment is tied to something:
		say " is tied tightly at both ends.";
	else if the number of handled rope segments is zero:
		say " looks far too heavy for me to carry, but I could probably drag it around.";
	else:
		say " is too heavy for me to lift the whole thing[if the player is carrying a rope segment], but I'm managing to drag it around[end if].";

The south end of the rope is a rope segment, privately-named. The south end of the rope is terminated at the north end of the rope. The printed name is "rope". Understand "rope", "end", "end of", "end of the" as the south end of the rope.

The middle of the rope is a rope segment, privately-named. The printed name is "rope". Understand "rope", "middle", "middle of", "part", "part of" as the middle of the rope.

Rule for printing the name of a rope segment (called r) while clarifying the parser's choice of something:
	if r is the middle of the rope:
		say "part I'm holding";
	otherwise if the player holds the middle of the rope:
		if r is tied to something (called the anchor):
			say "end tied to [the anchor]";
		otherwise if r is coiled:
			say "end hanging down from the pipe";
		otherwise:
			say "length coiled up on the ground";

Rule for implicitly taking a rope segment (called r):
	say "(first taking [the r])[command clarification break]";
	try taking r;
	assert that the player carries the middle of the rope issuing "Player segment carried.";
	redirect the action from r to the middle of the rope;

Before dropping a rope segment when the player is carrying the middle of the rope:
	if the noun is the middle of the rope, continue the action;
	try dropping the middle of the rope instead.

	say "The rope's too fat to tear into pieces."
	
Instead of burning a rope segment:
	say "The rope is [one of]soaked to its core from every time this place has flooded. It [once only]wouldn't burn even if I [i]had[r] something to light it with."

Instead of pushing a rope segment to a direction:
	if the player is not carrying a rope segment:
		carry out the implicitly taking activity with the noun;
	try going the second noun.

Instead of turning a rope segment:
	try pulling the noun instead;

Section 6.2 Going with Rope

The main warehouse is a region. The Loading Bay and Storage Bay are in the main warehouse.

Check going when the player carries the middle of the rope:
	unless the room gone to is in the main warehouse:
		try dropping the middle of the rope;
 		continue the action;

After going when the player carries the middle of the rope:

Section 6.4 - Looping Rope

The rope-looping rules are a rulebook.

A rope-looping rule when the rope nearby is coiled (this is the rope already coiled rule):
	say "I’d gain nothing from winding the rope any further around the pipe: it'd only make it harder to pull, and it wouldn't really make it any shorter." instead;

A rope-looping rule when the rope nearby is anchored (this is the rope tied down rule): 
	if the other end of the rope nearby is anchored:

Section 6.5 - Tying rope

Definition: a thing is a cleat:
	if it is the enormous packing crate, yes;
	if it is the warehouse door, yes;
	no;

Before fastening a rope segment to a long ladder:
	say "[one of]That sounds like it would make things [i]very[r] complicated, and won't achieve anything either![or]I can't usefully tie the rope to that.[stopping]" instead.

Before fastening a rope segment to the player:
	say "[one of]I don't fancy trussing myself up for the Figure to come find me[or]I don't think that's going to help me here[stopping]." instead.

The other end is tied to [the anchor of r] across the room but despite passing over one of the ceiling pipes there’s still plenty of slack in the system[otherwise]. The other end passes over one of the ceiling pipes and dangles free on the other side. I’ve made a pulley system, but it might not be enough to shift [the second noun][end if].";

After fastening a rope segment to a cleat when at least two on-stage rope segments are coiled:
	let r be the other end of the rope nearby;
	say "[if r is not anchored]I tie this end of my pulley system off to [the second noun].[otherwise]I haul down on this end of the rope, feeling the fibres stretch. When the whole system is as taut as I can get it, I loop it through [the second noun] and tie it tighter than one of Drake’s Viennese burns. As the system relaxes the door seems to move maybe a second’s hand from the floor...[end if]";

Section 6.6 - Untying rope

First for supplying a missing second noun when untying a rope segment from:
	if the player can see a cleat:
		if the rope nearby is tied to a cleat:
			change the second noun to the anchor of the noun;

Before untying the middle of the rope from something:
	redirect the action from the middle of the rope to the rope nearby;

Instead of untying a rope segment from something:

Part 11 - Storage

Storage Bay is a room, south of the Loading Bay. "The south end of the enormous room. There's another door to the east: less formidable than the others except for a sign that says KEEP OUT. Sounds promising[if the Gas Platform is unvisited] - perhaps this is the cupboard where the Figure sleeps[end if][if the warehouse door is open].[paragraph break]The enormous iron door has lifted just a couple of handspans from the floor.[end if]." The printed name is "Storage".

The south pipe is a warehouse pipe, in the Storage Bay. "The pipe's a fair few feet up the wall. What it's for is anyone's guess."

Instead of making to leave when in the Storage Bay:
	try going north.
Instead of going inside when in the Storage Bay:
	try going east.

Section 1 - Drain scenery

The drain_glimpse is a glimpse backdrop in Storage. The printed name is "drain". Understand "drain" as the drain_glimpse. The description is "The wide drain is to the north."

Instead of approaching or entering the drain_glimpse: try going north.


Chapter 2 - Warehouse Door

The warehouse door is a door, not open, not openable, not locked, not lockable, east of the Storage Bay, west of Gas Platform. "The enormous warehouse continues back to the north towards the drain I came up by. There’s a second fat pipe crossing the room here." The description is "The door is designed to slide up into the ceiling and in the centre of it is an iron ring for lifting. Presumably the Figure can just slide it up, but I certainly can’t[If the Warehouse Door is suspended and the warehouse door is closed]. The rope I’ve got tied to it might help though[otherwise if the warehouse door is open]. Instead I’ve got the rope tied to it, and my pulley system has lifted the whole thing about two feet from the floor[end if]."

Understand "iron door", "enormous door" as the warehouse door.


Instead of opening, pulling or pushing the closed warehouse door:
	say "It’s far heavier than me. I tug as best I can on the iron ring in the centre of the door, but there’s no way I can move it unaided.";

Instead of opening, closing, pulling or pushing the open warehouse door:
	say "It was hard enough getting it this far! I shouldn’t be ungrateful!";

After going through the warehouse door:
	say "[one of]Lying on my belly I pull myself through the gap into darkness. Halfway through I have a sudden horrible mental image: the Figure, standing by the crate in the drain with a candle to the rope that’s holding the enormous door above me. As quick as I can I pull myself through[or]I crawl under the door[stopping][if the player carries the long ladder]. Then I reach back through the gap and pull the ladder after me[end if].";
	continue the action;

Understand "gap" , "crack" as the warehouse door when the warehouse door is open.
Understand "crack of light", "light" as the warehouse door when the warehouse door is open and the location is the Gas Platform.

Instead of inserting something carried by the player into the open warehouse door:
	move the noun to the Gas Platform;
	say "I push [the noun] through the crack under the door."

Instead of doing something when the KEEP OUT sign is physically involved:
	say "I can't reach the sign, and anyway, it's clear enough."
 
The iron ring is part of the warehouse door. The description is "The ring is set in the middle of the door."



Instead of pulling or taking the iron ring:
	say "The door is way too heavy for me to lift (maybe if I was an army of a hundred men, I could do it. Maybe.)"

Instead of fastening something to the iron ring:
	try fastening the noun to the warehouse door instead.

Before inserting a rope segment into the iron ring:
	try fastening the noun to the warehouse door instead.

Before untying a rope segment from the iron ring:

	say "[if Gas Platform is murky]Darkness[otherwise]Gas Platform[end if]";

Rule for printing the description of the Gas Platform:
	if the Gas Platform is murky:
		say "I’m on some kind of metal platform in the dark. The crack of light below the door is enough to make out a few controls beside me and a set of stairs leading down to the north. Down seems an odd way to be going since we’re above the river. There’s probably serpents down there, or octopuses, or water-camels.";
	otherwise:
		say "I’m on a metal platform that sticks out over an impossibly large space, at least twice the size of the warehouse back west. The room below is deep: the original staircase to the north gives up halfway down[if the long ladder is stuck]. Beyond that there’s the ladder[end if].[paragraph break]In the light of a hundred gas-lamps I can see the carved earth walls. This whole place has been scooped clean out of the rock and it’s filled with rows upon rows of silent metal men: a whole army of statues. Perhaps somewhere amongst them is the Figure.";

Rule for writing a paragraph about the warehouse door when in the Gas Platform:
	now the warehouse door is mentioned;
	do nothing;

Chapter 2 - Staircase

Section 1 - Staircase

The broken staircase is a door, open, not openable, scenery, down from the Gas Platform, up from the Warehouse Basement, north from the Gas Platform. Understand "set of", "stair", "stairs", "step", "steps" as the broken staircase.

	try going down.

Instead of going through the broken staircase from the Gas Platform when the broken staircase is not fixed:
	if the Gas Platform is murky:
		say "[one of]I feel my way down the first few steps: then the metal underfoot starts to rock and sway. Perhaps all this is built on the water and is floating – or perhaps the supports have rotted and the staircase is about to fall. Terrified, I race back up to the safety of the platform.[or]I’m not going down that staircase in the dark. There’s something [i]wrong[r] about it.[stopping]";
	otherwise:
		say "The staircase ends halfway to the ground, in midair with nothing holding it up.";

After going through the broken staircase from the Gas Platform:
	say "There’s no way I’m turning my back on those metal men, so I swing round to the back of the ladder and climb down that, even though there’s a moment when I’m hanging out over an enormous drop.[paragraph break]None of them move as I make my way down.";

	try standing the long ladder up;
	continue the action;

Instead of standing the long ladder up when in the Gas Platform:
	if the Gas Platform is murky:
		say "It’s far too dark to go waving the ladder around in here. I’d probably knock myself out.";
	otherwise:
		move the long ladder to the location;
		now the long ladder is stuck;
		now the broken staircase is fixed;
		say "It takes a lot of awkwardness to get the ladder over the side and pointing down towards the floor. That's when I fumble it and let go. It lands with a crash - the top disappears into the dark - then swings back, settling against the platform. I exhale a long breath.[paragraph break]None of the metal men react.";

Chapter 3 - Gas controls

Section 1 - Control Panel

Some gas controls are scenery, in the Gas Platform. "The platform has a control box fitted to it. [if the Gas Platform is murky]There may be more controls out there in the dark but what’s visible is a button, a large lever, and a red-painted bolt.[otherwise]These are the controls for the gas-lights. There must be a big tank under the platform or something.[end if]"

Understand "control", "box", "platform", "railing" as the gas controls.

	say "I'm surrounded by a ring of tiny blue stars.";

Section 1b - Some fires, little and large

A ring of tiny stars is a thing. The description is "Tiny points of gentle blue light, all around me, the size of pinheads.

Understand "tiny", "points", "points of", "gentle", "blue", "light" as the ring of tiny stars. 

Instead of doing something when the ring of tiny stars are physically involved:
	say "[one of]The stars seem to be just a fraction beyond wherever I think they are, like they were slowly growing and moving away at the same time.[or]I can't seem to reach them.[stopping]";

Some gas flames are a backdrop. The description is "Blue flames burn all around the walls of this cavernous space, gleaming off the sides of the men[if the location is the gas Platform] below[end if]."  

Understand "gas-lamps", "lamp", "light", "lights", "gas-light", "gas-lights", "gaslamps", "gaslamp", "gaslight", "gaslights", "lamps", "carved/earth walls", "carved earth walls", "hundred" as the gas flames.

	say "They're well out of my reach."

Before smelling the gas flames:
	say "I can't smell them now they're lit." instead.

Before listening to the gas flames:
	say "They make a low noise, like breathing." instead.

Section 2 - Ignition Bolt

An ignition bolt is part of the gas controls. The description of the ignition bolt is "[if the Gas Platform is bright or the ignition button is ignited]Around the bolt is engraved HI, OFF and IGN. Whatever that means. There's not even an arrow to say which way it's pointing.[otherwise]The bolt’s just a bolt, but knowing my luck I’ll turn it and find it was the only thing holding this platform up.[end if]".

Understand "red", "red-painted", "red painted", "painted", "bolt" as the ignition bolt.

The ignition bolt has a number called the setting. The setting of the ignition bolt is 1.

Instead of smelling when in the Gas Platform and the setting of the ignition bolt is greater than 1 and the Gas Platform is murky:
	say "There's a strong smell, almost metallic, filling the air."
	
Instead of smelling when in the Gas Platform and setting of the ignition bolt is 1 and setting of the ignition bolt has been 2 and the Gas Platform is murky:

	try unscrewing the ignition bolt with the wrench.

Instead of unscrewing the ignition bolt with the wrench:
	abide by the bolt-turning rules;

Instead of screwing the ignition bolt in with the wrench:
	try unscrewing the noun with the second noun instead;

The bolt-turning rules are a rulebook.

A bolt-turning rule when the Gas Platform is bright:
	say "I've already got the lights working. I don't want to be in the dark now I've seen what's down there." instead;

A bolt-turning rule when the long lever is not armed:
	say "The bolt doesn’t seem to turn: partly because the lever’s in the way of the wrench handle." instead;

A bolt-turning rule when the ignition button is not ignited:
	change the setting of the ignition bolt to the remainder after dividing the setting of the ignition bolt by 3; [0, 1, 2]
	increase the setting of the ignition bolt by 1; [1, 2, 3]
	if the setting of the ignition bolt is:

			say "I heave the bolt around. The room is suddenly filled by a hissing sound, like a thousand baby cobras coiling and getting ready to strike! A strange smell comes with them." instead;
		-- 3:
			say "I turn the bolt further. The baby cobras grow up into hot-headed angry adult cobras the size of oak trees. I’m almost deafened by the noise." instead;
		-- 1:
			say "I heave the bolt further still. Abruptly, the room falls quiet." instead;

A bolt-turning rule when the ignition button is ignited:
	now the Gas Platform is bright;
	remove the monsters from play;
	remove the ring of tiny stars from play;
	move the gas flames backdrop to all gas-lit warehouse rooms;
	move glimpse_men to the Gas Platform;
	say "I heave the bolt around and the stars on the wall erupt into flame, filling the chamber with light! And what a chamber – deep and wide. This is like standing inside the clock of the Cathedral all over again. The room below must be carved out of the rock below the riverbed, and its walls are crisscrossed with pipes which are now providing light.[paragraph break]And the room is full of people. Men, standing in rows and staring at me. I freeze myself to the spot. They do the same. It's like the room was filled with mirrors reflecting my image. I wave a hand but nothing happens. Nothing at all. Then I realise that they're statues - statues in full armour - gleaming metal statues, more than I could count without growing thirty or forty more hands.[paragraph break]Whatever they are they must be connected to the Figure. There’s nothing for it, Wren, but to get a closer look somehow..." instead;

Definition: a room is gas-lit warehouse:
	if it is the Warehouse Basement, yes;
	if it is the Gas Platform, yes;
	no.

Section 3 - Lever

A long lever is part of the gas controls. The description of the long lever is "[if the Gas Platform is bright]A long metal lever labeled IGN in red letters.[otherwise]It feels like a metal lever, not as heavy as the one on the Difference Engine but still needing both hands to pull.[end if]"

Section 4 - Ignition

An ignition button is part of the gas controls. The description of the ignition button is "[if the Gas Platform is bright]A large brass button labeled IGN.[otherwise]Just underneath the lever is a large brass button. I can just make out three letters, side-by-side: I, G and N.[end if]"

	now the long lever is not armed;
	say "I push the button. The lever drops back suddenly almost taking my arm off! At the same time, the room is filled by a snapping noise and suddenly the darkness is full of stars! A whole sky of blue points. Where am I now? Outside? It's a huge space, wherever it is. The hissing noise has stopped, too." instead;

An ignition rule when the setting of the ignition bolt is 3:
	say "I push down on the button but it refuses to press. One of the cobras must have gotten stuck underneath it or something." instead;

Part 13 - Warehouse

The Warehouse Basement is a room. "I’m standing in a forest of eyes, and arms, and hands. There are metal men all around me, on every side, all slightly different. The flickering gas-lights make it look and sound like they’re breathing. Any one might be about to reach out a hand and grab my shoulder… I need to work out the Figure’s plan as quickly as possible and then get out of here. In one piece!"

Instead of going inside when in the Warehouse Basement:

Before listening when in the Warehouse Basement:
	say "The fuzz from the gas flames echoes between the soldiers like a whisper." instead.

The army of metal statues is scenery, in the Warehouse Basement. "Each man is made of fine steel and brass and stands upright, six foot tall. Their faces are bare faceplates with tiny glass eyes, but they all look like they’re crying because of deep channels for rain run-off that run from forehead to chin.

Instead of doing something when the army of metal statues is physically involved:
	say "With shaking fingers I open the hatch on the front of the nearest man. No surprise maybe to find he’s full of clockwork, but it’s clockwork like I’ve never seen before: cogs so small it’s like his whole body is infested with woodlice and scrambling maggots. It’s like someone had taken the whole of the Difference Engine and shrunk it to fit.[paragraph break]Except there’s obviously something missing. All those cogs would need a spring about the size of the metal man’s head and it would need to be placed right in the middle where it could unwind to every part of his body. But in the perfect spot there’s nothing but a gap, like someone built this machine but forgot to give it a heart. What good are these men if all they do is stand in line?[paragraph break]That’s when I notice the seal. Something embossed on the inside of the chest hatch. I take a step back to see it more clearly – a winding key above an ocean wave, familiar from somewhere – and step into something firm and solid. A man out of line?[paragraph break]A hand grips my throat. 'Who sent you here?' demands a voice, smooth and icy. A voice I know well, that I should have expected. 'Who else knows about this place? Tell me before I crush every pinion in your neck.'[paragraph break]My toes are scrabbling on - off - the ground. I try to scream but nothing comes out beyond a whisper. I can see the outline of the Figure’s cowl and beyond that, for the first time, almost make out an unhappy face underneath.[paragraph break]'You’ll tell me or you’ll die here,' the Figure says ever-so-softly. 'You’ll die cold and alone like the rat you are.'[paragraph break]The room is getting darker. The tank for the gas lamps must be running low. Soon it’ll be me and the Figure and all these men, and no-one will ever find me or know where I’ve gone. Or is that someone? In the background? A shape, a shadow, my imagination or…[paragraph break]'Covalt?' I whisper, in desperation. 'Covalt, is that…'[paragraph break]Then the lights disappear completely. The heavy cord of the clock-key round my neck has become tangled while I was asleep. The stars are coming out. I’m underwater again.";

Still in there? That’s good enough.' The voice is old and crumbling like the stones of the Abbey walls. Covalt. 'I found you on my doorstep. Hour ago, or more than that. Wasn’t sure you were breathing. Don’t know how people tick and you can’t wind them back up when they're gone.' Behind his thick brows I can see sympathy. 'I'm glad you're all right.'"

SE_RETURN_2 is a scripted event. The display text is "'Found this with you,' Covalt adds, holding up a scrap of paper that looks like a postage stamp in his gigantic hand. 'Stay away – this is what it says, you see, not what I'm telling you. Stay away or the child will… Well.' The old man pauses, awkwardly. 'It says to stay away, whichever-wards.'"

'Give each one a heart that never needs no winding. Imagine soldiers that can't never be stopped. More like a plague than an army.'[paragraph break]'But for what?'[paragraph break]Covalt shrugs. 'We won’t find out. Copying the Perpetuum? That’s like jamming a second spring into a working balance. Too much power. Or too much of something.' In a moment Covalt is on his feet again. 'Here’s how I see it. We need to stop the Figure but we can’t. We stop him today and he’ll be back tomorrow. He’s going to steal that Perpetuum and he won't never give up, so somehow we’ve got to put the chocks in [i]after[r] that.'[paragraph break]I'm shaking my head.

'Did I tell you could go walking off with that?'[paragraph break]'I...'[paragraph break]Then the grin breaks out across his face; like a sunrise through dirty windows. 'Because that’s a bloody brilliant thought from a brain as small as yours. Brilliant. I was saying I couldn’t build a Perpetuum, wasn’t I? But I can always build a box. Doesn’t take nothing to build a box. Because a trap is just a nice box with something nasty inside. Here.'[paragraph break]Digging in a pocket he pulls out three screws, a key, a length of wire coiled into a helix, a plane file, a square of sandpaper and then finally, three shiny silver minutes that make my eyes light up.[paragraph break]'There’s an autopothecary over the street,' he says gleefully. 'You get yourself in there and buy the strongest sleeping drug you’re old enough to buy. Then we’ll spring-load it into a decoy Perpetuum and next morning there’ll be a sleeping Figure in the Cathedral vaults ready to be locked up and forgotten.'[paragraph break]";

And on the inside is a tight spring attached to a little hammer from a bell-strike ready to the break the glass, right about a small needle.[paragraph break]Gingerly Covalt picks up the bottle, and fits it into the box.

They’ll be grateful and then they’ll send us up the scaffold. But we’ll face that when the hands come round for it. You ready?'[paragraph break]I nod. What else can I do?[paragraph break]'Sneak into the vaults and swap this over. So good luck and I’m not coming with you. If they ask you where you got this from you say it fell from the stars.'

If Drake finds you he’d [i]string you up![run paragraph on][r]' His voice is shaking. I’ve never heard him so angry. Or not angry – afraid. The whites of his eyes have turned yellow. 'You’ve got to go. [i]This isn’t a game![r]'[line break][paragraph break]He grabs my arm as he speaks – here it comes, I’m thinking – then he drags me away through the nave of the church, hissing at me to stay quiet, all the way to the front gate. 'Go. All right? Please. Don’t tell anyone.'[paragraph break]Then he – and his feeble candle – have disappeared back inside.";

A detection rule:
	say "[one of]'Wren, please!' Calvin hisses. He looks awful, almost sick. 'Don't stay here. You stupid [i]novice[r]. And if you do stay here, [i]hide[r]. Whatever you do.

Understand "pendulum" as the enormous penduluum.

Instead of swinging or turning the stopped enormous penduluum:

I don’t think I ever spoke to him and he was so near-blind he probably never saw me at all.[paragraph break]I don’t think he can see me now, either, even though that’s him, propped up in a stone niche in the wall of the tunnel to the south.[or]The walls are smooth stones but into some are built triangular niches. Can’t I just tell you about the niches? Do I have to tell you about the skeletons and bodies sitting up inside them?[paragraph break]Round the head of each is tied a small round dial – a deathwatch. They make no sound at all.[paragraph break]The tunnel goes south[if the Crypt Landing is unvisited]. So will I, once I gather the courage[end if].[stopping]"

	say "I pick up a dowel. It’s a good length, but far too light to use as a cudgel. (And I’m too much of a wimp to use it as one, too.)"

Instead of taking the dowels:
	say "I’ve already got one.";

The dowel handle is a thing. The description is "It’s a good length, the size and shape of my forearm." The printed name is "handle". Understand "wooden handle", "wooden dowel", "rod", "wooden rod" as the dowel handle.

Rule for printing the description of the lit makeshift torch:
	say "Clockwork can do a lot of things: tell the time, move the wheels of a cart, operate pistons and machines, move the stars and the Earth, even predict the weather. But clockwork can’t make Light.

	remove the makeshift torch from play;
	now the player carries everything that is part of the makeshift torch;
	say "[one of]I reach up to light the linen head of the torch. It ignites and begins to glower with flame. Then ashes break off, and soon the whole thing has burned to nothing.[or]I burn the linen on the torch-head to nothing. It’s no good without fuel![stopping]";

Part 6 - Dark Stair

Chapter 1 - Description

The Dark Stair is a room, south from the Crypt Landing. "The stairs down from the landing end in midair. Everything beyond is darkness[if the player is carrying a lit candle], so vast the light of my candle is lost, like a dust-mote in the Cathedral itself. If I had a hundred candles, maybe I could see something. As it is, with this candle, I cannot see - I can only [i]be[r] seen...[else].[end if]"

Before going up when in the Dark Stair: try going north instead.
Before making to leave when in the Dark Stair: try going north instead.
Before going inside when in the Dark Stair: try going down instead.
Before going south when in the Dark Stair: try going down instead.

After going from the Dark Stair to the Crypt Landing when the lit makeshift torch was not visible:
	say "I climb gratefully back out of the darkness.";
	continue the action.

Rule for printing the description of the Dark Stair when the player can see the lit makeshift torch:
	if the gnomon tip is in the location:
		say "There’s a gap, between the end of the stairs, and the start of the smooth stone slope that disappears downwards into the dark. It’s no staircase, but there are worn-down depressions down its length. It’s a handspan wide and no more.[paragraph break]";
	otherwise:
		say "I’m at the bottom of a staircase with nothing but the dark below.[paragraph break]";
	say "The step before the last step is wider than the others: on the left a metal sconce is fixed to the wall[if the makeshift torch is in the sconce], holding my torch proudly[end if]. On the right is a low stone pedestal. If I started to fall I could grab onto either!"

After going from the Crypt Landing to the Dark Stair when TRIG_DARK_STAIR is unfired:
	fire TRIG_DARK_STAIR;
	continue the action;

TRIG_DARK_STAIR is a trigger.

Rule for firing unfired TRIG_DARK_STAIR when the player has the lit makeshift torch:
	say "The stairs disappear downwards. I must be lower than the Abbey well by now, maybe even lower than the spring of St Philip itself. My hands are running over stone bricks – then slick rock seamed with rough minerals.[paragraph break]Then, quite suddenly, the stairs come to an end in mid-air. Below them is empty space: my torch is like the scratch of a fingernail on the Polar Ice. It’s as though the world was hollow and I had reached its rotten core.";

Rule for firing unfired TRIG_DARK_STAIR:
	if the player can see a lit candle:
		say "Almost total darkness. I'm taking it one step at a time, like I was climbing a ladder. Then just as I'm getting used to the pace, the next step gets deeper and deeper and I look down to see nothing, not the slightest glimmer of stone beneath my weight... ";
	else:
		say "Total darkness. I’m feeling my way – one step, then another, like I was coming down the ladder from my room. Then just as I’m getting the hang of it, the deep step gets deeper and deeper and I realise my foot is heading out into nothingness because the stairs have stopped… ";
	say "with no time to pull back I sit down, sharply. Below me is empty air – could be a handspan, could be the height of a tower. The air is still, and cold. The darkness around could be the size of the night.";

Instead of dropping something in the Dark Stair:
	say "I can’t risk it rolling and disappearing into space.";

Instead of examining the lit candle in the Dark Stair when the player cannot see the lit makeshift torch:
	say "The candle throws out a circle of light; nothing like enough to fill this cavernous space."

Instead of facing down when in the Dark Stair and the player cannot see the gnomon tip:
	say "Endless dark."

Chapter 2 - Scenery

Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of the Dark Stair:
	if the player can see the lit makeshift torch, no;
	if the particular possession is the sconce, yes;
	if the particular possession is the granite column, yes;



Section 1 - Staircase

A dangling stair is scenery, in the Dark Stair. "[if the player can see the gnomon tip]The stairs have joined to a smooth stone slope that slides downward into the dark[else]Each step is a carved stone block, dangling from the block before. In the end they’re all supported by nothing. Only darkness lies below[end if]."  Understand "staircase", "stairs" as the dangling stair.

Understand "darkness", "dark", "space" as the dangling stair when the player cannot see the gnomon tip.

Before ascending or climbing the dangling stair:
	try going up instead.

Before descending the dangling stair:
	try going down instead.

Instead of jumping off the dangling stair:
	try jumping instead.

Instead of touching the dangling stair:
	say "The stones are strangely warm - I had expected them to be cold."

Section 2 - Sconce

A sconce is scenery, a container, in the Dark Stair. "It’s an iron pike with a bracket set on the wall. The bracket is wrought to look like the rays of a sun." 

Instead of taking the sconce:
	say "It’s fixed into the stone. That means it’s a solid handhold.";
 
Instead of climbing the sconce:
	say "If I want to go back up I'm going to run back up the stairs, not up the wall."

Instead of pushing or pulling or turning or attacking the sconce:
	say "[one of]It's been here for centuries. It takes more than the likes of me to move something like that[or]It's fixed into the stones[stopping]."

Understand "solid", "wrought", "iron", "metal", "sconce", "pike", "bracket", "sun", "rays", "holder" as the sconce.

After inserting the lit makeshift torch into the sconce:
	say "I slot the torch neatly into the sconce. Light pours down over the pedestal opposite.";

After taking the lit makeshift torch when the makeshift torch was in the sconce:
	say "I lift the torch back out of the sconce.";

Section 3 - Pedestal

A granite column is scenery, a supporter, in the Dark Stair. "A granite column, waist-high on a man which means chin-height to me. The surface is marked with ridges and slots in some kind of design – maybe there used to be something here, some kind of treasure that was ripped away – or a goblin – or a heretical device powered by water or the movement of ants." 

The printed name of the granite column is "pedestal". Understand "low", "stone", "pedestal" as the granite column.

Instead of pushing, pulling the granite column:
	try turning the noun instead;

After putting the plate sundial on the granite column:
	now the plate sundial is part of the granite column;
	say "The sundial fits the pedestal-top precisely, almost as if the ancients who built it were capable of engineering. But primitives had no Mechanics. It was St Newton who brought us out of the dark."

Instead of touching the granite column:
	say "Granite has a texture like sand, only harder than time itself."

Instead of putting something on the granite column:
	if the noun is the plate sundial, continue the action;
	if the noun is the decoy Perpetuum Mobile:
		say "I need to replace the [i]real[r] Perpetuum - otherwise the Figure will know it's a trap!" instead;
	say "I don't think [the noun] [is-are] meant to fit the pedestal."

Instead of climbing or entering or standing on the granite column:
	say "It's pretty narrow. I don't want to be teetering on top of that, when there's a drop like this one below me..."

The granite surface is part of the granite column. Understand "ridge", "chiselled", "lines", "neat" , "ridges", "dust", "slot", "slots", "markings", "design" as the granite surface. The description is "A series of neat lines, chiselled into the stone, too deep to see to down them. They must be filled with dust now." Instead of touching the granite surface: say "It's beautifully carved."

Section 4 - Gnomon Control (Assembled Pedestal)

Definition: the granite column is assembled if the plate sundial is part of it.
Definition: the granite column is unassembled unless it is assembled.

The granite column has a number called the shadow setting. The shadow setting of the granite column is 4.

Instead of rotating when the noun is the unassembled granite column:
	say "The pedestal seems to shift but only for a moment before locking up[one of]. It might be a crank with a cam or a cam without a key, as the Abbot would say, but either way it won’t go[once only].";

Before doing something when the plate sundial is involved and the granite column is assembled:
	redirect the action from the plate sundial to the granite column;
	try the current action instead;

Instead of taking the assembled granite column:
	say "The sundial seems to have locked into place and I can’t see how[one of]. With a sinking feeling I realise I’ve made things easier for the Figure, not harder[once only].";

Rule for printing the description of the assembled granite column:
	say "The sundial sits on the granite pedestal, slotted neatly into place. [if the lit makeshift torch is in the sconce]The torchlight casts a needlepoint shadow: the time is [shadow setting of the granite column in words][otherwise]The light of my torch is making the time leap like crazy, as though the Earth had come loose from its bearing and was rolling end over end past the sun[end if]."

Before rotating when the noun is the assembled granite column and the player carries the makeshift torch:
	say "If I'm going to shift this pedestal around I’ll need my hands free. I can't do it holding this torch." instead;

Instead of turning the assembled granite column:
	[ We rig turning forwards to go a bit faster towards 12 o'clock, for those who do things the brute force way. ]
	let time to midnight be 12 - the shadow setting of the granite column;
	if time to midnight is greater than 1:
		if time to midnight is greater than 4:
			let time to midnight be 4;
		let turn distance be a random number between 1 and the time to midnight;
	else:
		let turn distance be 1;
	let n be the shadow setting of the granite column + turn distance;
	while n is greater than 12:
		change n to n - 12; [13 becomes 1]
	try number-setting the noun to n;

Instead of turning the assembled granite column backwards:
	let n be the shadow setting of the granite column - 1;
	while n is less than 1:
		change n to n + 12; [0 becomes 12]
	try number-setting the granite column to n;

Instead of number-setting the assembled granite column to when the number understood is less than 1:
	say "The clock face reaches from one to twelve.";

Instead of number-setting the assembled granite column to when the number understood is greater than 12:
	say "The clock face reaches from one to twelve.";

Instead of number-setting the assembled granite column to when the number understood is the shadow setting of the granite column:
	say "The shadow is already pointing at [shadow setting of the granite column in words].";

Instead of number-setting the assembled granite column to when the shadow setting of the granite column is 12:
	say "I can’t get the gnomon to turn any more[one of]. Maybe the Abbot was hoping the Figure would simply run off this stair into the dark. And instead, I’ve saved him...[or].[stopping]";

Instead of number-setting the assembled granite column to:
	change the shadow setting of the granite column to the number understood;
	say "[one of]I grab the edges of the pedestal and heave. To my surprise, it turns without trouble, like some great weight had been quietly counterbalanced away.[or]I put both hands on the pedestal and drag it round.[or]I haul on the pedestal.[stopping]";
	consider the gnomon rules;

Instead of setting the assembled granite column to "midnight/noon":
	try number-setting the granite column to 12 instead.

Instead of setting the assembled granite column to:
	say "The sundial is labelled with numbers, from one to midnight."

The gnomon rules are a rulebook.

A gnomon rule when the shadow setting of the granite column is 12:
	move the gnomon tip to the Dark Stair; 
	say "The shadow on the face of the gnomon creeps round to midnight and after settling for a moment, the stairs underneath me start to shake, as if they were being lifted from underneath! [i]Now you’ve done it, Wren. This whole place is going to fall! [r][paragraph break]But it doesn’t. Instead, something massive – stone, moving on ancient castors – wheels into place at the end of the stairs. A smooth stone slope, leading down." instead;

A gnomon rule when the shadow setting of the granite column is 1 or the shadow setting of the granite column is 11:
	say "The shadow settles at [shadow setting of the granite column in words] o’clock[one of]. In the darkness, I hear something grumble and groan in response, like there was a giant trapped down there and the sundial was the lock on its cage.[or]. Whatever’s down there is right by me![or].[stopping]" instead;

A gnomon rule:
	say "The shadow moves to [shadow setting of the granite column in words] o'clock. [one of]In the dark, something whispers and mutters.[or]Whatever’s down there in the darkness grumbles again, like it was dragging gigantic feet.[or]The grumbling is louder now.[or]Something is definitely moving down there, in the dark, and by the sound of it, it’s the size of the Cathedral itself.[or]The machinery responds, huge and awful.[stopping]" instead;

Section 5 - Gnomon Tip

The gnomon tip is privately-named, scenery. 
Understand "smooth", "slope", "stone slope", "wire" as the dangling stair when the player can see the gnomon tip.

Instead of going down from the Dark Stair when the player can not see the gnomon tip:
	say "There’s nothing but space there! I’m not jumping!";

The Middle of the Gnomon is a room, down from the Dark Stair. "The light from above quickly disappears. I’m left [if the player can see the lit makeshift torch]with just my torch[else]in darkness, worse than before[end if]. There aren’t even any walls to hang on to. I can feel the stone underfoot getting thinner and thinner, until I’m standing on a wire..."

The printed name of the middle of the gnomon is "Gnomon".

After deciding the scope of the player when in the middle of the gnomon:

Chapter 1 - Description

The Henge is a room. "I’m standing at the base of the gnomon in a cavern that rivals the dome of the sky for its size. Around its perimeter are twelve stones: twelve giants, staring down at me. This is a sundial, all in shadow, with no sun to cast a time. Water drips from the ceiling.

The Figure will come, soon enough.";

After firing SE_BRASSHEAD_5 when the loop count of the brass head is 2:

I’m tiring, getting slower, winding down...[paragraph break]And then the bells ring out for midnight. All over the city and all at once. A hundred voices – screeching bells, low bells that grumble the way Cook does, beautiful bells, angry bells - and all are shouting one thing: [i]faster, Wren, faster. However fast your clock ticks, tick faster[r].[paragraph break]And with the City behind me I can. Not winding down: breaking every Law, I’m winding up, soaking energy in.

	fire TRIG_COVALT_FIGURE_2A;

TRIG_COVALT_FIGURE_2A is a trigger.

Rule for firing unfired TRIG_COVALT_FIGURE_2A:
	say "Covalt is struggling, but I can see the fight coming back into his eyes. The Figure is clockwork, and Covalt [i]knows[r] about clockwork..."

Every turn when in Covalt's Bedroom and the third-state of Covalt is 2 during Midnight:
	fire TRIG_COVALT_FIGURE_2;

TRIG_COVALT_FIGURE_2 is a trigger.

Rule for firing fired TRIG_COVALT_FIGURE_2:
	change the third-state of Covalt to 3;
	say "'You’re a machine,' Covalt growls. 'Just some two-bit machine run amok with gremlins in your gears.'[paragraph break]The Figure’s voice is impassive, just as it always has been. 'Better a machine than a feeble man.'[paragraph break]But Covalt grins, and the sight makes my heart soar with pride. 'Machines are fine,' he says. 'Till they need repairing. That’s when they come to me. When someone’s jammed something in their winding slot and snapped their spring.'";

TRIG_COVALT_FIGURE_3 is a trigger.

Every turn when in Covalt's Bedroom and the third-state of Covalt is 3 during Midnight:
	fire TRIG_COVALT_FIGURE_3;

Rule for firing fired TRIG_COVALT_FIGURE_3:
	change the third-state of Covalt to 4;
	say "'Now!' Covalt shouts. 'Jam something in, whatever you’ve got!'";

Section 6 - Figure

Understand "surprise figure" as a mistake ("Great idea, but [i]how[r]?") when the location is the Bedroom and Midnight is happening.

Instead of giving the real perpetuum mobile to the Figure in grey during Midnight:
	say "I'm not giving up now!"

Instead of talking to the Figure Grey during Midnight:
	say "I stay silent. For now, he hasn't seen me..."

Before asking the Figure Grey about during Midnight:
	try talking to the Figure Grey instead.
Before telling the Figure Grey about during Midnight:
	try talking to the Figure Grey instead.

The winding slot is part of the Figure Grey. 

Understand "crack", "dark crack" as the winding slot.
Understand "neck", "figure's neck", "figures neck", "back of" as the winding slot.

The wound spring is part of the winding slot. It is privately-named. [ you can't just attack ]

The description of the winding slot is "A weak point in every device. A way straight in to the heart of the clockwork. The imperfection needed to jam a perfect mechanism..."

Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of the figure in grey:
	if the particular possession is the winding slot:
		if Midnight is happening and the third-state of Covalt is not 1:
			no; [winding slot has been revealed by the ravens...]
		yes; [...otherwise it is concealed...]
	no; [...but nothing else is! -- e.g. cloak.]

Rule for printing the description of the figure in grey when the third-state of Covalt is 1 during Midnight:
	say "The Figure looms over Covalt like a gigantic rearing slug.";

Rule for printing the description of the figure in grey when the third-state of Covalt is greater than 1 during Midnight:
	say "It’s almost impossible to believe: all that speed, all the strength, that voice... all in a machine...";

Rule for printing the description of the figure in grey during Midnight:
	say "The ravens are keeping the Figure busy but not busy enough. He’ll never tire!";


Understand "winding key" as the lucky clock key when Midnight is happening.

Section - Attack Figure

Instead of turning [winding] the Figure Grey during Midnight:
	try attacking the winding slot;

Instead of turning [winding] the winding slot during Midnight:
	try attacking the winding slot;

Instead of attacking the Figure Grey when Midnight is happening:
	say "[one of]The Figure is more powerful than me. I’ve got the element of surprise on my side... and nothing else![or]He's too strong to attack directly...[or]I need to find his weakness, and I need to find it now![or]Maybe clockwork guide my hand... and until it does, I don't stand a chance![stopping]";
		
Instead of attacking the Figure Grey when Midnight is happening and the third-state of Covalt is greater than 1:
	try attacking the winding slot instead.

Instead of attacking the winding slot when Midnight is happening and the third-state of Covalt is greater than 1 for the first time:
	say "I could jam his winding slot, but with what?"

Instead of attacking the winding slot when Midnight is happening and the third-state of Covalt is greater than 1 for the second time:
	try unlocking the winding slot with the lucky clock key.

Section - Attack Figure with 

Instead of attacking the figure grey with something when the player can see the winding slot:
	try unlocking the winding slot with the second noun;

Instead of attacking the winding slot with something when the player can see the winding slot:
	try unlocking the winding slot with the second noun;

Section - Insert into Figure

Before inserting something into the Figure Grey when the player can see the winding slot during Midnight:
	try unlocking the winding slot with the noun instead;

Before inserting something into the winding slot during Midnight:
	try unlocking the winding slot with the noun instead;

Section - Insert into Figure

Before unscrewing the Figure Grey with something when the player can see the winding slot during Midnight:

Section - Pre-emptive Attempts

Instead of unscrewing the Figure Grey with something during Midnight:
	try attacking the Figure Grey with the second noun.
Instead of inserting something into the Figure grey during Midnight:
	try attacking the Figure Grey with the noun.

Instead of attacking the Figure Grey with something during Midnight:
	say "[The second noun] isn't much of a weapon. I need to confuse him somehow!"

Section - Successfull Attempt

Instead of unlocking the figure grey with something when the player can see the winding slot:
	redirect the action from the figure in grey to the winding slot, and try that instead;

An unlocking rule for the figure grey when the player can see the winding slot and the player can see my lucky clock key:
	rule succeeds with result my lucky clock key;
[	otherwise:
		rule fails;]


An unlocking rule for the winding slot when the player can see my lucky clock key:
	rule succeeds with result my lucky clock key;
[	otherwise:
		rule fails;]

Instead of unlocking the winding slot with my lucky clock key:
	try attacking the wound spring instead;

Instead of unlocking the winding slot with something:
	if the second noun is the knife:
		say "The knife, my trusted weapon, is too big for the tiny keyhole of the winding slot..." instead;
	if the second noun is the wrench:
		say "The wrench is a huge tool - if the Figure was a man, I could maybe cudgel him - but it would merely glance his neck and bounce away...";


Every turn when in Covalt's Bedroom and the player can see the winding slot and the third-state of Covalt is 4:
	say "[one of]The Figure's fingers are closing on Covalt's neck - but his own neck is exposed...[or]The Figure's winding slot is open...[or]The winding slot on the back of the Figure's neck is right in front of me...[cycling]";

Section 7 - Game end - attacking the wound spring


Instead of attacking the wound spring:
	now the player wears my lucky clock key;
	try attacking the wound spring with my lucky clock key instead;

Instead of attacking the wound spring with my lucky clock key:
	say "The winding slot on the Figure's neck is a thumb-width big. A tiny target, like fitting a tweezer's head into the cracks of a mesh-system. But precision is what clockwork’s all about. I’m a novice. I’m trained. And I know that the winding slot goes all the way in. Right into the Figure’s clockwork soul.[paragraph break]I grab the key from around my neck and plunge it in. The Figure doesn’t notice – it can’t feel! – until I start to turn.[paragraph break]The spring begins to coil. The Figure jerks up, releasing Covalt, who falls back to the floor. It struggles to turn, trying to make a grab for me, but the ravens on either side are battering it back. I only need another turn or two. The spring inside the neck is getting almost impossible to move and then...[paragraph break]CRACK![paragraph break]I can hear the spring spinning off inside the Figure’s chest. Hear the awful noise as it catches in a mechanism deep inside. I quickly make the sign of the Winding Key as the Figure crumples: first one leg, then the other. The floor shakes as it falls.[paragraph break]The last of its energy is enough to look up at me. 'You,' it hisses through lips that don’t move as it speaks. Its voice sounds almost sad. 'You know not what you do.'[paragraph break]And then, silence. The ravens settle, one on each of Covalt’s shoulders. The old man looks exhausted, his face the colour of bruised tomatoes.";
	now the third-state of Covalt is 10;

After reading a command when the third-state of Covalt is 10:
	say "'That’s the most incredible piece of clockwork I ever saw,' he says slowly, furiously, his eyes glowing with anger. 'And you just destroyed it.'[paragraph break]Can Covalt really be angry that I...[paragraph break]'That was well done, young Wren.' He coughs. 'But I tell you, when I build something like that metal man, I’m going to give him an off-switch. Stupid to have to break such a fine machine. Whoever built that... a genius.' He strokes his beard, and gets to his feet – taking the Perpetuum from me as he does so. He’s looking back to normal already: a sour-faced moody old man. 'A genius, and an idiot, too.'[paragraph break]'But who was it?' I demand. 'Who built it?'[paragraph break]'That’s the question,' Covalt answers, gravely. 'For every spring that’s wound on this Earth, there’s a human hand turning the key. No divine mechanics down here. We may be free of this thing –' and he lands a kick squarely in the still automaton’s chest - 'but someone out there was behind it. Someone planning an army and after the Perpetuum.'[paragraph break]Covalt grunts, and scratches his chest with a thick finger. He seems almost to be falling asleep.[paragraph break]'There's clockwork, Wren,' he says. 'But then again, there's [i]clockmakers[r].'";
[ Bodge: it seems in debug you can win the game in this activity, but in release you can't. So we fix the player's command to something safe... ]
	replace the player's command with "look";
	end the game saying "To Be Continued...";

[ ... and then ignore it to end the game ]
First before when the third-state of Covalt is 10: [ this is absurd, I'm just trying to get the game to stop! ] 
	do nothing instead.
