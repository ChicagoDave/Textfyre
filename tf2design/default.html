				When the monks took me, aged six months, into their care, they named 
				me Wren. Maybe because I was small, insignificant, and happy to 
				eat any crumbs they threw my way. But these days I&#39;m Wren, 2nd Assistant 
				Clock Polisher... and that&#39;s a role that&#39;s about as important in 
				the workings of the Cathedral of Time as the large deaf man who 
				re-stretches the worn-out springs.<br />
				<br />
				&quot;HEY WREN!&quot;<br />
				<br />
				Uh-oh.<br />
				<br />
				&quot;We&#39;ve got a job for you!&quot;<br />
				<br />
				&quot;Yeah, a promotion!&quot;<br />
				<br />
				This, coming from Drake and Calvin, means something horrible is 
				about to happen.<br />
				<br />
				&quot;You&#39;ve got your rag, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
				<br />
				&quot;And your polish?&quot;<br />
				<br />
				&quot;Yes,&quot; I bleat, holding up the glass tumbler they&#39;ve given me.<br />
				<br />
				&quot;Course you do. Well, we&#39;ve got something for you to do.&quot;<br />
				<br />
				&quot;Yeah,&quot; chimes Calvin.<br />
				<br />
				One on each arm, they march me down the hall, towards the Abbot&#39;s 
				door. Am I in trouble? Going to be thrown out of the Cathedral?<br />
				<br />
				&quot;On three!&quot; shouts Drake.<br />
				<br />
				&quot;Tick!&quot; Calvin counts. &quot;Tick! Tock!&quot;<br />
				<br />
				They shove me through the door. I fall into the Abbot&#39;s personal 
				chamber. I might not know much about the Abbey but I do know that 
				I really shouldn&#39;t be in here.<br />

				<b>Abbot&#39;s Quarters</b><br />
				If I thought Abbots lived in luxury, then I was dead wrong. Even 
				my attic&#39;s cozier than this. The Abbot&#39;s got no furniture at all, 
				except a desk and a cot, and no decoration except for a bust of 
				St. Newton. None of the axle-mounted, bevelled mobiles I was expecting. 
				There&#39;s barely even any sunlight: one thin window to catch the sunrise, 
				opposite the door to the hallway back west.<br />
				<br />
				St. Newton is staring at the Abbot&#39;s unpolished Grandfather clock 
				with a severe frown.<br />
