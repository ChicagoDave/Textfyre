            Jack Toresal and the Secret Letter</h1>
        <p>
            Textfyre&#39;s first commercial Interactive Fiction game was released on June 26th,
            2009. Set in the town of Toresal in the kingdom of Miradania, Secret Letter is an
            adventure about a fourteen year old orphan that everyone knows as &quot;Jack&quot;.
            Jack is pulled into a dangerous mystery when a handful of Baron Fossville&#39;s
            mercenaries begin hunting him. From Grubber&#39;s Market through Commerce Street,
            and onto Lord&#39;s Keep; Jack is faced with numerous challenges. Teisha lends a
            hand along the way, as does Bobby, the mysterious boy always lurking in Lord&#39;s
            Market. The ladies at Maiden House are helpful, but can sometimes be a bit overbearing.
            The shopkeepers are always willing to chat about the latest gossip. Jack, he just
            wants to sit down and eat an apple.
