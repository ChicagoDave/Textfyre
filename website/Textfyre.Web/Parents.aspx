        <h1>Information about Interactive Fiction for Parents</h1>
        <p> Dear Parents,</p>
        <p> My name is David Cornelson and I created Textfyre for you and your kids. I have
            children of my own and I know how hard it is to keep them entertained in today's
            world. The battle over the television, the computer, the game console, the Nintendo
            DS and Leapster games is non-stop. As parents we're always fretting over whether
            allowing our kids access to these outlets is good for them.</p>
        <p> At Textfyre we take the approach that all of these outlets exist, aren't going away,
            and the best we can do is offer alternatives. With that in mind, we started developing
            computer games that we would want our children to play.</p>
        <p> Our games are a combination of a chapter book and a game. As the player, you get
            to tell the main character what to do, using the keyboard and entering natural language
            commands. </p>
        <p> We hope you take the time to play the online demos of Jack Toresal and The Secret
            Letter and The Shadow in the Cathedral.</p>
        <p> Please mention our products to your teachers and librarians so we can share the
            fun of reading and solving story puzzles. </p>
        <p> Sincerely,</p>
        <p> David A. Cornelson<br />
            Founder and President</p>
    </div>
