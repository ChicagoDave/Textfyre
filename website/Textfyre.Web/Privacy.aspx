        <a name="3"></a><h2>The Way We Use Information:</h2>
    <p>
        We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to
        complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except
        to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
    <p>
        We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only
        to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with
        outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
    <p>
        We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are
        not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>
    <p>
        You can register with our website if you would like to receive updates on our new
        products and services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for
        this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.</p>
    <p>
        We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and
        to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number
        of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and
        Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything
        that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>
    <p>
        Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided
        to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing
        you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>

        <a name="4"></a><h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use
            of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
            procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>

            <a name="5"></a><h2>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</h2>
        <p>
            Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason,
            we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know
            are under 18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18.</p>
            <a name="6"></a><h2>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online
            and maintain by using the My Settings page. We use this procedure to better safeguard
            your information.</p>
        <p>
            To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify
            your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
