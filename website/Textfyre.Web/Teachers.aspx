        <h1>Information about Interactive Fiction for Teachers</h1>
       <h2>Our Passion for Learning</h2>
             <p> In 2006 we started developing the idea of sharing our hobby with middle school kids
            because we believe there's a special place for it in schools and on home computers.
            Interactive Fiction provides hours of reading practice as well as the opportunity
            to improve cognitive thinking skills. It's also fun. In no other medium does the
            reader get to tell the main character of a story what to do - in their own words.
            This includes telling the player to get in trouble, escape from trouble, and stay
            out of trouble. We write stories that teach kids about honesty and bravery, as well
            as just making them think outside of the box.</p>
         <h2>Teacher Features</h2>
            <p>We welcome your ideas about our current products and promise to incorporate as many
            of your ideas into our products as possible. For instance, we can do really interesting
            things with Interactive Fiction. We can offer a version of each game that requires
            each student to login. Each time they interact with the game, their sentences are
            stored in a database. As the teacher, you can pull up a report for each student,
            to see how they've interacted with the story and how they've progressed. You can
            see exactly who is reading at a higher level and who is struggling. We even track
            how long it takes for the student to enter each command sentence, giving you information
            on how easily they use the computer and potentially how quickly they read. And those
            mischievous kids will think twice when you ask them why they're trying to kiss or
            kick everything in the game! </p>
         <h2>Play the Demo versions!</h2>
            <p>When you play the demo of Secret Letter, try holding down the Ctrl key on your keyboard.
            You'll see some of the words display in red. Each of these words has a built-in
            pop-up definition. If you click a red word, a balloon displays the definition. It's
            features like this that you'll never find in a regular book. </p>
        <h2>Classroom Edition Coming Soon</h2>
            <p>We're putting the finishing touches on the new Classroom Edition. This edition will focus
            on allowing teachers to purchase and setup student access as well as letting students log
            in anonymously. Teachers will be able to view reports on each student's progress and students
            will see their progress in the number of hurdles they've crossed. The Classroom Edition will
            be available online through the Textfyre.Com website. </p>
