            Gears and cogs, racks and pinions, wheels within wheels within wheels. This is the
            substance of life for Wren, a ward of the monks in the Abbey of Time. In the city
            of St. Phillip, everything runs by clockwork, including the government and the church.
            As Second Assistant Clock Polisher in the Abbey of Time, Wren is the smallest gear
            in the vast machine. But big things can happen when even the smallest gear slips
            out of place.

            If you’re new to Interactive Fiction, or Text Adventures, we would like to take
            you on a small tour to show you how it works. Interactive Fiction is a both a game
            and story combined. It allows you, the player, to act as the main character in the
            story. To do this, you enter natural language commands using your keyboard. One
            of the first things you want to learn how to do is to move around. Unlike a video
            game, there isn’t an animated character to move about with your mouse. Instead,
            you will tell the main character where you want them to go. In order to make this
            task easy, we provide you with simple compass directions like NORTH, NORTHEAST,
            and EAST, UP, DOWN, IN, or OUT that you can type to move
            <div style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;">
                <img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="height: 164px; width: 159px" /></div>
            the main character through the setting of the game. The map of St. Philip is very
            big, with over ninety-five locations to visit. You will visit some of these locations
            once and others several times. One good idea is to use paper and pencil to draw
            a map of St. Philip as you move about. This way, you can remember where everything
            is as you play. Movement commands can be abbreviated; so instead of typing GO NORTH
            or NORTH, you can simply type N and the game will understand what you mean.
