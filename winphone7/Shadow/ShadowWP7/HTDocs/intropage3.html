            Once you're comfortable moving around in an Interactive Fiction game, you'll notice
            that each location has a detailed description. Within this description there are
            clues that might help you solve a puzzle. For instance, a kitchen may have a drawer
            that you could open by typing OPEN DRAWER. This might reveal silverware, where you
            might be able to type TAKE KNIFE. There may also be a garbage disposal where you
            could, well, dispose of something; PUT EVIDENCE IN GARBAGE DISPOSAL. And of course
            you'd need to activate the disposal, so there's likely going to be a switch on the
            wall somewhere nearby. TURN DISPOSAL ON. Don't forget to TURN DISPOSAL OFF. But
            pay attention at all times and read every description thoroughly. The game you're
            playing may do things differently than you would at home. The trick is to become
            immersed in the story and enter commands that make sense to the main character.
            If you have decided to pick up things, you can review your INVENTORY at anytime.
            If you think a particular object is more interesting than others, you may try to
            EXAMINE it. If you don't need something, go ahead and DROP it anywhere. Be careful
            though, almost everything has some usefulness.

            One of the amazing things within an Interactive Fiction story is the other characters
            milling about. Some of these characters will move around from location to location.
            Some will follow you. Some will try to avoid you. Some might try to hurt you. And
            some of them might try talking to you. And if they don't, you can always try to
            TALK TO them. You can also SHOW things to people and BUY things from others.</div>

            If you feel you're about to make an important decision and would like to SAVE your
            place, don't worry, you can always RESTORE it later. If you want to start over,
            just RESTART the game at any time. You can also click on the Table of Contents tab
            and use the menu items for saving and loading your place in a game.
