            To give you a feel for how to play Shadow, we've put together a transcript of an
            imaginary game. In this game, you are being chased by zombies…
        </div>
        <div style="font-family: Courier New; font-size: 14px; text-align: left; margin-top: 5px;">
            <p>
                The world has run amuck and you're one of the last survivors. You've managed to
                make a home for yourself in town, despite the handful of zombies shuffling about.
                Luckily it's a small town. You can't imagine trying to survive in one of the major
                metropolitan areas.</p>
            <p>
                The sun is shining and it looks to be a beautiful day. It would be good to go grocery
                shopping and maybe pick up a DVD.</p>
            <p>
                Front Porch</br> This is the front porch of your adopted home. It's one of those
                large wrap-around porches, surrounding a large house on a hill. You can see the
                rest of the town clearly from here. A few zombies can be seen in the distance. It
                looks safe to go about your business. You can head down into town or back inside
                the house. The porch leads north and south to the sides of the house.</p>
            <p>
                > I</br> You're carrying a grocery list.</p>
            <p>
                > READ LIST</br> It has frozen pizzas, frozen vegetables, pop, and cereal listed.</p>
            <p>
                > DOWN</br> You saunter down the hill, paying very close attention to all directions.
            </p>
            <p>
                East End of Main Street</br> This is the east end of Main Street that intersects
                with Cuyahoga Boulevard. The grocery store is further downtown to the west. Cuyahoga
                leads out of town and unsafe areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                > WEST</br> Between Cuyahoga and Saunter on Main Street</br> This is (or was) the
                government section of downtown. The police department is on the north side of the
                block while the post office and chamber of commerce are on the south side.
            </p>
            <p>
                A zombie comes around the corner and senses your presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                > X ZOMBIE</br> It's a man with a red plaid shirt, not sure who, which is a good
                thing. It's always way creepier when you know who the zombie was when they were
                “alive”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The zombie shuffles closer and is now about 30 yards away.
            </p>
            <p>
                > WEST</br> Saunter and Main Street</br> The intersection has a few burned out cars
                and leads in all four cardinal directions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Plaid Zombie shuffles closer and is now about 20 yards away. He seems to be
                picking up speed too. You hear his teeth clacking and a moan escapes his throat.
            </p>
            <p>
                > WEST</br> Between Saunter and Fillmore on Main Street</br> This block has a small
                grocery store on the north side named “Cullins” and an assortment of clothing and
                sundry stores on the south side.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Plaid Zombie is shuffling towards you at a faster pace and is close enough to
                warrant attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                > PUNCH ZOMBIE</br> You wind up a good punch to the neck of the Plaid Zombie and
                your hand slips through and gets caught. The Plaid Zombie grabs you and its teeth
                clack faster. Another zombie, wearing a party dress, comes around the corner.
            </p>
            <p>
                > REMOVE HAND FROM PLAID ZOMBIE</br> You pull your hand out by kicking the Plaid
                Zombie in the stomach. Your hand comes free, but now your foot is entangles in its
                intestines. The Plaid Zombie is wrestling with your leg while the Party Zombie nears.
            </p>
            <p>
                > REMOVE FOOT FROM PLAID ZOMBIE</br> You do a backwards somersault and flip the
                Plaid Zombie over your head. He lands a few feet away and begins to rise to his
                feet. The Party Zombie is now close enough to warrant attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                > NORTH</br> This is Cullins Grocery, a small town store with everything the last
                person on the planet would need, for a few months anyway. There are eight aisles
                with signs above each one.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Plaid and Party Zombie are nearing the store entrance and a third zombie, wearing
                a football jersey and helmet, is close behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                > READ SIGNS</br> 1 – Bread and Cereal</br> 2 – Canned Food, Rice, and Beans</br>
                3 – Salad Dressing, Pickles, Olives</br> 4 – Household Items</br> 5 – Frozen Foods</br>
                6 – Cookies, Candy, Popcorn</br> 7 – Dairy</br> 8 – Soda and Chips</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                > GO TO AISLE 1</br> Aisle 1 – Bread and Cereal</br> This aisle used to have bread,
                but perishables were the first items to disappear. There's still a large selection
                of cereal, your favorite being Ghoulie O's (the irony always makes you smile). The
                aisle leads south to the entrance and north to the meat counter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Plaid, Party, and Football Zombies are entering Aisle 1. Slowly.
            </p>
            <p>
                > X CEREAL</br> There isn't much left. The zombies don't eat cereal, but there must
                be other non-zombies because someone else is definitely shopping here too. Luckily
                they don't like your favorite, Ghoulie O's.
            </p>
            <p>
                The three zombies are tripping over each other, but getting closer.
            </p>
            <p>
                > TAKE CEREAL</br> Check, got the cereal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Football Zombie presses ahead of the other two and ducks for a tackle.
            </p>
            <p>
                > SOUTH</br> You step aside as the Football Zombie dives onto the floor (you love
                that move) and then head out the other side of the aisle, away from the zombies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meat Counter</br> This is the meat counter of Cullin's. No one's bothered the seafood
                (which isn't doing so well) but the rest of the meat has been cleared out (zombie
                or human, you know not). The deli is west and the produce section is east. You can
                also head up any of the 10 aisles.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Plaid and Party zombie pass the Football Zombie in aisle 1, who is struggling
                to get back to his feet.
            </p>
            <p>
                > GO TO AISLE 5
            </p>
            <p>
                Frozen Foods</br> There are refrigerators on both sides filled with pizzas, vegetables,
                ice cream and other items.
            </p>
            <p>
                You hear moaning and clacking teeth coming from the north.</p>
